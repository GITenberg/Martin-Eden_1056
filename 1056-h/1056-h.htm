<h1>MARTIN EDEN</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>The one opened the door with a latch-key and went in, followed by
a young fellow who awkwardly removed his cap.&nbsp; He wore rough clothes
that smacked of the sea, and he was manifestly out of place in the spacious
hall in which he found himself.&nbsp; He did not know what to do with
his cap, and was stuffing it into his coat pocket when the other took
it from him.&nbsp; The act was done quietly and naturally, and the awkward
young fellow appreciated it.&nbsp; &ldquo;He understands,&rdquo; was
his thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll see me through all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked at the other&rsquo;s heels with a swing to his shoulders,
and his legs spread unwittingly, as if the level floors were tilting
up and sinking down to the heave and lunge of the sea.&nbsp; The wide
rooms seemed too narrow for his rolling gait, and to himself he was
in terror lest his broad shoulders should collide with the doorways
or sweep the bric-a-brac from the low mantel.&nbsp; He recoiled from
side to side between the various objects and multiplied the hazards
that in reality lodged only in his mind.&nbsp; Between a grand piano
and a centre-table piled high with books was space for a half a dozen
to walk abreast, yet he essayed it with trepidation.&nbsp; His heavy
arms hung loosely at his sides.&nbsp; He did not know what to do with
those arms and hands, and when, to his excited vision, one arm seemed
liable to brush against the books on the table, he lurched away like
a frightened horse, barely missing the piano stool.&nbsp; He watched
the easy walk of the other in front of him, and for the first time realized
that his walk was different from that of other men.&nbsp; He experienced
a momentary pang of shame that he should walk so uncouthly.&nbsp; The
sweat burst through the skin of his forehead in tiny beads, and he paused
and mopped his bronzed face with his handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Arthur, my boy,&rdquo; he said, attempting to mask
his anxiety with facetious utterance.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is too much
all at once for yours truly.&nbsp; Give me a chance to get my nerve.&nbsp;
You know I didn&rsquo;t want to come, an&rsquo; I guess your fam&rsquo;ly
ain&rsquo;t hankerin&rsquo; to see me neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; was the reassuring answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be frightened at us.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re just
homely people&mdash;Hello, there&rsquo;s a letter for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped back to the table, tore open the envelope, and began to
read, giving the stranger an opportunity to recover himself.&nbsp; And
the stranger understood and appreciated.&nbsp; His was the gift of sympathy,
understanding; and beneath his alarmed exterior that sympathetic process
went on.&nbsp; He mopped his forehead dry and glanced about him with
a controlled face, though in the eyes there was an expression such as
wild animals betray when they fear the trap.&nbsp; He was surrounded
by the unknown, apprehensive of what might happen, ignorant of what
he should do, aware that he walked and bore himself awkwardly, fearful
that every attribute and power of him was similarly afflicted.&nbsp;
He was keenly sensitive, hopelessly self-conscious, and the amused glance
that the other stole privily at him over the top of the letter burned
into him like a dagger-thrust.&nbsp; He saw the glance, but he gave
no sign, for among the things he had learned was discipline.&nbsp; Also,
that dagger-thrust went to his pride.&nbsp; He cursed himself for having
come, and at the same time resolved that, happen what would, having
come, he would carry it through.&nbsp; The lines of his face hardened,
and into his eyes came a fighting light.&nbsp; He looked about more
unconcernedly, sharply observant, every detail of the pretty interior
registering itself on his brain.&nbsp; His eyes were wide apart; nothing
in their field of vision escaped; and as they drank in the beauty before
them the fighting light died out and a warm glow took its place.&nbsp;
He was responsive to beauty, and here was cause to respond.</p>
<p>An oil painting caught and held him.&nbsp; A heavy surf thundered
and burst over an outjutting rock; lowering storm-clouds covered the
sky; and, outside the line of surf, a pilot-schooner, close-hauled,
heeled over till every detail of her deck was visible, was surging along
against a stormy sunset sky.&nbsp; There was beauty, and it drew him
irresistibly.&nbsp; He forgot his awkward walk and came closer to the
painting, very close.&nbsp; The beauty faded out of the canvas.&nbsp;
His face expressed his bepuzzlement.&nbsp; He stared at what seemed
a careless daub of paint, then stepped away.&nbsp; Immediately all the
beauty flashed back into the canvas.&nbsp; &ldquo;A trick picture,&rdquo;
was his thought, as he dismissed it, though in the midst of the multitudinous
impressions he was receiving he found time to feel a prod of indignation
that so much beauty should be sacrificed to make a trick.&nbsp; He did
not know painting.&nbsp; He had been brought up on chromos and lithographs
that were always definite and sharp, near or far.&nbsp; He had seen
oil paintings, it was true, in the show windows of shops, but the glass
of the windows had prevented his eager eyes from approaching too near.</p>
<p>He glanced around at his friend reading the letter and saw the books
on the table.&nbsp; Into his eyes leaped a wistfulness and a yearning
as promptly as the yearning leaps into the eyes of a starving man at
sight of food.&nbsp; An impulsive stride, with one lurch to right and
left of the shoulders, brought him to the table, where he began affectionately
handling the books.&nbsp; He glanced at the titles and the authors&rsquo;
names, read fragments of text, caressing the volumes with his eyes and
hands, and, once, recognized a book he had read.&nbsp; For the rest,
they were strange books and strange authors.&nbsp; He chanced upon a
volume of Swinburne and began reading steadily, forgetful of where he
was, his face glowing.&nbsp; Twice he closed the book on his forefinger
to look at the name of the author.&nbsp; Swinburne! he would remember
that name.&nbsp; That fellow had eyes, and he had certainly seen color
and flashing light.&nbsp; But who was Swinburne?&nbsp; Was he dead a
hundred years or so, like most of the poets?&nbsp; Or was he alive still,
and writing?&nbsp; He turned to the title-page . . . yes, he had written
other books; well, he would go to the free library the first thing in
the morning and try to get hold of some of Swinburne&rsquo;s stuff.&nbsp;
He went back to the text and lost himself.&nbsp; He did not notice that
a young woman had entered the room.&nbsp; The first he knew was when
he heard Arthur&rsquo;s voice saying:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth, this is Mr. Eden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The book was closed on his forefinger, and before he turned he was
thrilling to the first new impression, which was not of the girl, but
of her brother&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; Under that muscled body of his he
was a mass of quivering sensibilities.&nbsp; At the slightest impact
of the outside world upon his consciousness, his thoughts, sympathies,
and emotions leapt and played like lambent flame.&nbsp; He was extraordinarily
receptive and responsive, while his imagination, pitched high, was ever
at work establishing relations of likeness and difference.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Eden,&rdquo; was what he had thrilled to&mdash;he who had been called
&ldquo;Eden,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Martin Eden,&rdquo; or just &ldquo;Martin,&rdquo;
all his life.&nbsp; And &ldquo;<i>Mister</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was certainly
going some, was his internal comment.&nbsp; His mind seemed to turn,
on the instant, into a vast camera obscura, and he saw arrayed around
his consciousness endless pictures from his life, of stoke-holes and
forecastles, camps and beaches, jails and boozing-kens, fever-hospitals
and slum streets, wherein the thread of association was the fashion
in which he had been addressed in those various situations.</p>
<p>And then he turned and saw the girl.&nbsp; The phantasmagoria of
his brain vanished at sight of her.&nbsp; She was a pale, ethereal creature,
with wide, spiritual blue eyes and a wealth of golden hair.&nbsp; He
did not know how she was dressed, except that the dress was as wonderful
as she.&nbsp; He likened her to a pale gold flower upon a slender stem.&nbsp;
No, she was a spirit, a divinity, a goddess; such sublimated beauty
was not of the earth.&nbsp; Or perhaps the books were right, and there
were many such as she in the upper walks of life.&nbsp; She might well
be sung by that chap, Swinburne.&nbsp; Perhaps he had had somebody like
her in mind when he painted that girl, Iseult, in the book there on
the table.&nbsp; All this plethora of sight, and feeling, and thought
occurred on the instant.&nbsp; There was no pause of the realities wherein
he moved.&nbsp; He saw her hand coming out to his, and she looked him
straight in the eyes as she shook hands, frankly, like a man.&nbsp;
The women he had known did not shake hands that way.&nbsp; For that
matter, most of them did not shake hands at all.&nbsp; A flood of associations,
visions of various ways he had made the acquaintance of women, rushed
into his mind and threatened to swamp it.&nbsp; But he shook them aside
and looked at her.&nbsp; Never had he seen such a woman.&nbsp; The women
he had known!&nbsp; Immediately, beside her, on either hand, ranged
the women he had known.&nbsp; For an eternal second he stood in the
midst of a portrait gallery, wherein she occupied the central place,
while about her were limned many women, all to be weighed and measured
by a fleeting glance, herself the unit of weight and measure.&nbsp;
He saw the weak and sickly faces of the girls of the factories, and
the simpering, boisterous girls from the south of Market.&nbsp; There
were women of the cattle camps, and swarthy cigarette-smoking women
of Old Mexico.&nbsp; These, in turn, were crowded out by Japanese women,
doll-like, stepping mincingly on wooden clogs; by Eurasians, delicate
featured, stamped with degeneracy; by full-bodied South-Sea-Island women,
flower-crowned and brown-skinned.&nbsp; All these were blotted out by
a grotesque and terrible nightmare brood&mdash;frowsy, shuffling creatures
from the pavements of Whitechapel, gin-bloated hags of the stews, and
all the vast hell&rsquo;s following of harpies, vile-mouthed and filthy,
that under the guise of monstrous female form prey upon sailors, the
scrapings of the ports, the scum and slime of the human pit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down, Mr. Eden?&rdquo; the girl was saying.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have been looking forward to meeting you ever since Arthur
told us.&nbsp; It was brave of you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waved his hand deprecatingly and muttered that it was nothing
at all, what he had done, and that any fellow would have done it.&nbsp;
She noticed that the hand he waved was covered with fresh abrasions,
in the process of healing, and a glance at the other loose-hanging hand
showed it to be in the same condition.&nbsp; Also, with quick, critical
eye, she noted a scar on his cheek, another that peeped out from under
the hair of the forehead, and a third that ran down and disappeared
under the starched collar.&nbsp; She repressed a smile at sight of the
red line that marked the chafe of the collar against the bronzed neck.&nbsp;
He was evidently unused to stiff collars.&nbsp; Likewise her feminine
eye took in the clothes he wore, the cheap and unaesthetic cut, the
wrinkling of the coat across the shoulders, and the series of wrinkles
in the sleeves that advertised bulging biceps muscles.</p>
<p>While he waved his hand and muttered that he had done nothing at
all, he was obeying her behest by trying to get into a chair.&nbsp;
He found time to admire the ease with which she sat down, then lurched
toward a chair facing her, overwhelmed with consciousness of the awkward
figure he was cutting.&nbsp; This was a new experience for him.&nbsp;
All his life, up to then, he had been unaware of being either graceful
or awkward.&nbsp; Such thoughts of self had never entered his mind.&nbsp;
He sat down gingerly on the edge of the chair, greatly worried by his
hands.&nbsp; They were in the way wherever he put them.&nbsp; Arthur
was leaving the room, and Martin Eden followed his exit with longing
eyes.&nbsp; He felt lost, alone there in the room with that pale spirit
of a woman.&nbsp; There was no bar-keeper upon whom to call for drinks,
no small boy to send around the corner for a can of beer and by means
of that social fluid start the amenities of friendship flowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have such a scar on your neck, Mr. Eden,&rdquo; the girl
was saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did it happen?&nbsp; I am sure it must
have been some adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Mexican with a knife, miss,&rdquo; he answered, moistening
his parched lips and clearing his throat.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was just a
fight.&nbsp; After I got the knife away, he tried to bite off my nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baldly as he had stated it, in his eyes was a rich vision of that
hot, starry night at Salina Cruz, the white strip of beach, the lights
of the sugar steamers in the harbor, the voices of the drunken sailors
in the distance, the jostling stevedores, the flaming passion in the
Mexican&rsquo;s face, the glint of the beast-eyes in the starlight,
the sting of the steel in his neck, and the rush of blood, the crowd
and the cries, the two bodies, his and the Mexican&rsquo;s, locked together,
rolling over and over and tearing up the sand, and from away off somewhere
the mellow tinkling of a guitar.&nbsp; Such was the picture, and he
thrilled to the memory of it, wondering if the man could paint it who
had painted the pilot-schooner on the wall.&nbsp; The white beach, the
stars, and the lights of the sugar steamers would look great, he thought,
and midway on the sand the dark group of figures that surrounded the
fighters.&nbsp; The knife occupied a place in the picture, he decided,
and would show well, with a sort of gleam, in the light of the stars.&nbsp;
But of all this no hint had crept into his speech.&nbsp; &ldquo;He tried
to bite off my nose,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; the girl said, in a faint, far voice, and he noticed
the shock in her sensitive face.</p>
<p>He felt a shock himself, and a blush of embarrassment shone faintly
on his sunburned cheeks, though to him it burned as hotly as when his
cheeks had been exposed to the open furnace-door in the fire-room.&nbsp;
Such sordid things as stabbing affrays were evidently not fit subjects
for conversation with a lady.&nbsp; People in the books, in her walk
of life, did not talk about such things&mdash;perhaps they did not know
about them, either.</p>
<p>There was a brief pause in the conversation they were trying to get
started.&nbsp; Then she asked tentatively about the scar on his cheek.&nbsp;
Even as she asked, he realized that she was making an effort to talk
his talk, and he resolved to get away from it and talk hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just an accident,&rdquo; he said, putting his hand
to his cheek.&nbsp; &ldquo;One night, in a calm, with a heavy sea running,
the main-boom-lift carried away, an&rsquo; next the tackle.&nbsp; The
lift was wire, an&rsquo; it was threshin&rsquo; around like a snake.&nbsp;
The whole watch was tryin&rsquo; to grab it, an&rsquo; I rushed in an&rsquo;
got swatted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, this time with an accent of comprehension,
though secretly his speech had been so much Greek to her and she was
wondering what a <i>lift</i> was and what <i>swatted</i> meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man Swineburne,&rdquo; he began, attempting to put his
plan into execution and pronouncing the <i>i</i> long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swineburne,&rdquo; he repeated, with the same mispronunciation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The poet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swinburne,&rdquo; she corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the chap,&rdquo; he stammered, his cheeks
hot again.&nbsp; &ldquo;How long since he died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I haven&rsquo;t heard that he was dead.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She looked at him curiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where did you make his acquaintance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never clapped eyes on him,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I read some of his poetry out of that book there on the table just before
you come in.&nbsp; How do you like his poetry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereat she began to talk quickly and easily upon the subject
he had suggested.&nbsp; He felt better, and settled back slightly from
the edge of the chair, holding tightly to its arms with his hands, as
if it might get away from him and buck him to the floor.&nbsp; He had
succeeded in making her talk her talk, and while she rattled on, he
strove to follow her, marvelling at all the knowledge that was stowed
away in that pretty head of hers, and drinking in the pale beauty of
her face.&nbsp; Follow her he did, though bothered by unfamiliar words
that fell glibly from her lips and by critical phrases and thought-processes
that were foreign to his mind, but that nevertheless stimulated his
mind and set it tingling.&nbsp; Here was intellectual life, he thought,
and here was beauty, warm and wonderful as he had never dreamed it could
be.&nbsp; He forgot himself and stared at her with hungry eyes.&nbsp;
Here was something to live for, to win to, to fight for&mdash;ay, and
die for.&nbsp; The books were true.&nbsp; There were such women in the
world.&nbsp; She was one of them.&nbsp; She lent wings to his imagination,
and great, luminous canvases spread themselves before him whereon loomed
vague, gigantic figures of love and romance, and of heroic deeds for
woman&rsquo;s sake&mdash;for a pale woman, a flower of gold.&nbsp; And
through the swaying, palpitant vision, as through a fairy mirage, he
stared at the real woman, sitting there and talking of literature and
art.&nbsp; He listened as well, but he stared, unconscious of the fixity
of his gaze or of the fact that all that was essentially masculine in
his nature was shining in his eyes.&nbsp; But she, who knew little of
the world of men, being a woman, was keenly aware of his burning eyes.&nbsp;
She had never had men look at her in such fashion, and it embarrassed
her.&nbsp; She stumbled and halted in her utterance.&nbsp; The thread
of argument slipped from her.&nbsp; He frightened her, and at the same
time it was strangely pleasant to be so looked upon.&nbsp; Her training
warned her of peril and of wrong, subtle, mysterious, luring; while
her instincts rang clarion-voiced through her being, impelling her to
hurdle caste and place and gain to this traveller from another world,
to this uncouth young fellow with lacerated hands and a line of raw
red caused by the unaccustomed linen at his throat, who, all too evidently,
was soiled and tainted by ungracious existence.&nbsp; She was clean,
and her cleanness revolted; but she was woman, and she was just beginning
to learn the paradox of woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying&mdash;what was I saying?&rdquo;&nbsp; She
broke off abruptly and laughed merrily at her predicament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was saying that this man Swinburne failed bein&rsquo;
a great poet because&mdash;an&rsquo; that was as far as you got, miss,&rdquo;
he prompted, while to himself he seemed suddenly hungry, and delicious
little thrills crawled up and down his spine at the sound of her laughter.&nbsp;
Like silver, he thought to himself, like tinkling silver bells; and
on the instant, and for an instant, he was transported to a far land,
where under pink cherry blossoms, he smoked a cigarette and listened
to the bells of the peaked pagoda calling straw-sandalled devotees to
worship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Swinburne fails,
when all is said, because he is, well, indelicate.&nbsp; There are many
of his poems that should never be read.&nbsp; Every line of the really
great poets is filled with beautiful truth, and calls to all that is
high and noble in the human.&nbsp; Not a line of the great poets can
be spared without impoverishing the world by that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was great,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly, &ldquo;the
little I read.&nbsp; I had no idea he was such a&mdash;a scoundrel.&nbsp;
I guess that crops out in his other books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many lines that could be spared from the book you
were reading,&rdquo; she said, her voice primly firm and dogmatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must &rsquo;a&rsquo; missed &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he announced.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What I read was the real goods.&nbsp; It was all lighted up an&rsquo;
shining, an&rsquo; it shun right into me an&rsquo; lighted me up inside,
like the sun or a searchlight.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way it landed
on me, but I guess I ain&rsquo;t up much on poetry, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off lamely.&nbsp; He was confused, painfully conscious of
his inarticulateness.&nbsp; He had felt the bigness and glow of life
in what he had read, but his speech was inadequate.&nbsp; He could not
express what he felt, and to himself he likened himself to a sailor,
in a strange ship, on a dark night, groping about in the unfamiliar
running rigging.&nbsp; Well, he decided, it was up to him to get acquainted
in this new world.&nbsp; He had never seen anything that he couldn&rsquo;t
get the hang of when he wanted to and it was about time for him to want
to learn to talk the things that were inside of him so that she could
understand.&nbsp; <i>She</i> was bulking large on his horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Longfellow&mdash;&rdquo; she was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve read &rsquo;m,&rdquo; he broke in impulsively,
spurred on to exhibit and make the most of his little store of book
knowledge, desirous of showing her that he was not wholly a stupid clod.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;The Psalm of Life,&rsquo; &lsquo;Excelsior,&rsquo; an&rsquo;
. . . I guess that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head and smiled, and he felt, somehow, that her smile
was tolerant, pitifully tolerant.&nbsp; He was a fool to attempt to
make a pretence that way.&nbsp; That Longfellow chap most likely had
written countless books of poetry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, miss, for buttin&rsquo; in that way.&nbsp; I guess
the real facts is that I don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; much about such
things.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t in my class.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;
to make it in my class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It sounded like a threat.&nbsp; His voice was determined, his eyes
were flashing, the lines of his face had grown harsh.&nbsp; And to her
it seemed that the angle of his jaw had changed; its pitch had become
unpleasantly aggressive.&nbsp; At the same time a wave of intense virility
seemed to surge out from him and impinge upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you could make it in&mdash;in your class,&rdquo; she
finished with a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are very strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her gaze rested for a moment on the muscular neck, heavy corded,
almost bull-like, bronzed by the sun, spilling over with rugged health
and strength.&nbsp; And though he sat there, blushing and humble, again
she felt drawn to him.&nbsp; She was surprised by a wanton thought that
rushed into her mind.&nbsp; It seemed to her that if she could lay her
two hands upon that neck that all its strength and vigor would flow
out to her.&nbsp; She was shocked by this thought.&nbsp; It seemed to
reveal to her an undreamed depravity in her nature.&nbsp; Besides, strength
to her was a gross and brutish thing.&nbsp; Her ideal of masculine beauty
had always been slender gracefulness.&nbsp; Yet the thought still persisted.&nbsp;
It bewildered her that she should desire to place her hands on that
sunburned neck.&nbsp; In truth, she was far from robust, and the need
of her body and mind was for strength.&nbsp; But she did not know it.&nbsp;
She knew only that no man had ever affected her before as this one had,
who shocked her from moment to moment with his awful grammar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I ain&rsquo;t no invalid,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;When
it comes down to hard-pan, I can digest scrap-iron.&nbsp; But just now
I&rsquo;ve got dyspepsia.&nbsp; Most of what you was sayin&rsquo; I
can&rsquo;t digest.&nbsp; Never trained that way, you see.&nbsp; I like
books and poetry, and what time I&rsquo;ve had I&rsquo;ve read &rsquo;em,
but I&rsquo;ve never thought about &rsquo;em the way you have.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t talk about &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
like a navigator adrift on a strange sea without chart or compass.&nbsp;
Now I want to get my bearin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mebbe you can put me right.&nbsp;
How did you learn all this you&rsquo;ve ben talkin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By going to school, I fancy, and by studying,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to school when I was a kid,&rdquo; he began to object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but I mean high school, and lectures, and the university.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gone to the university?&rdquo; he demanded in
frank amazement.&nbsp; He felt that she had become remoter from him
by at least a million miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going there now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m taking special
courses in English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not know what &ldquo;English&rdquo; meant, but he made a mental
note of that item of ignorance and passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long would I have to study before I could go to the university?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>She beamed encouragement upon his desire for knowledge, and said:
&ldquo;That depends upon how much studying you have already done.&nbsp;
You have never attended high school?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; But
did you finish grammar school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had two years to run, when I left,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I was always honorably promoted at school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment, angry with himself for the boast, he had gripped
the arms of the chair so savagely that every finger-end was stinging.&nbsp;
At the same moment he became aware that a woman was entering the room.&nbsp;
He saw the girl leave her chair and trip swiftly across the floor to
the newcomer.&nbsp; They kissed each other, and, with arms around each
other&rsquo;s waists, they advanced toward him.&nbsp; That must be her
mother, he thought.&nbsp; She was a tall, blond woman, slender, and
stately, and beautiful.&nbsp; Her gown was what he might expect in such
a house.&nbsp; His eyes delighted in the graceful lines of it.&nbsp;
She and her dress together reminded him of women on the stage.&nbsp;
Then he remembered seeing similar grand ladies and gowns entering the
London theatres while he stood and watched and the policemen shoved
him back into the drizzle beyond the awning.&nbsp; Next his mind leaped
to the Grand Hotel at Yokohama, where, too, from the sidewalk, he had
seen grand ladies.&nbsp; Then the city and the harbor of Yokohama, in
a thousand pictures, began flashing before his eyes.&nbsp; But he swiftly
dismissed the kaleidoscope of memory, oppressed by the urgent need of
the present.&nbsp; He knew that he must stand up to be introduced, and
he struggled painfully to his feet, where he stood with trousers bagging
at the knees, his arms loose-hanging and ludicrous, his face set hard
for the impending ordeal.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>The process of getting into the dining room was a nightmare to him.&nbsp;
Between halts and stumbles, jerks and lurches, locomotion had at times
seemed impossible.&nbsp; But at last he had made it, and was seated
alongside of Her.&nbsp; The array of knives and forks frightened him.&nbsp;
They bristled with unknown perils, and he gazed at them, fascinated,
till their dazzle became a background across which moved a succession
of forecastle pictures, wherein he and his mates sat eating salt beef
with sheath-knives and fingers, or scooping thick pea-soup out of pannikins
by means of battered iron spoons.&nbsp; The stench of bad beef was in
his nostrils, while in his ears, to the accompaniment of creaking timbers
and groaning bulkheads, echoed the loud mouth-noises of the eaters.&nbsp;
He watched them eating, and decided that they ate like pigs.&nbsp; Well,
he would be careful here.&nbsp; He would make no noise.&nbsp; He would
keep his mind upon it all the time.</p>
<p>He glanced around the table.&nbsp; Opposite him was Arthur, and Arthur&rsquo;s
brother, Norman.&nbsp; They were her brothers, he reminded himself,
and his heart warmed toward them.&nbsp; How they loved each other, the
members of this family!&nbsp; There flashed into his mind the picture
of her mother, of the kiss of greeting, and of the pair of them walking
toward him with arms entwined.&nbsp; Not in his world were such displays
of affection between parents and children made.&nbsp; It was a revelation
of the heights of existence that were attained in the world above.&nbsp;
It was the finest thing yet that he had seen in this small glimpse of
that world.&nbsp; He was moved deeply by appreciation of it, and his
heart was melting with sympathetic tenderness.&nbsp; He had starved
for love all his life.&nbsp; His nature craved love.&nbsp; It was an
organic demand of his being.&nbsp; Yet he had gone without, and hardened
himself in the process.&nbsp; He had not known that he needed love.&nbsp;
Nor did he know it now.&nbsp; He merely saw it in operation, and thrilled
to it, and thought it fine, and high, and splendid.</p>
<p>He was glad that Mr. Morse was not there.&nbsp; It was difficult
enough getting acquainted with her, and her mother, and her brother,
Norman.&nbsp; Arthur he already knew somewhat.&nbsp; The father would
have been too much for him, he felt sure.&nbsp; It seemed to him that
he had never worked so hard in his life.&nbsp; The severest toil was
child&rsquo;s play compared with this.&nbsp; Tiny nodules of moisture
stood out on his forehead, and his shirt was wet with sweat from the
exertion of doing so many unaccustomed things at once.&nbsp; He had
to eat as he had never eaten before, to handle strange tools, to glance
surreptitiously about and learn how to accomplish each new thing, to
receive the flood of impressions that was pouring in upon him and being
mentally annotated and classified; to be conscious of a yearning for
her that perturbed him in the form of a dull, aching restlessness; to
feel the prod of desire to win to the walk in life whereon she trod,
and to have his mind ever and again straying off in speculation and
vague plans of how to reach to her.&nbsp; Also, when his secret glance
went across to Norman opposite him, or to any one else, to ascertain
just what knife or fork was to be used in any particular occasion, that
person&rsquo;s features were seized upon by his mind, which automatically
strove to appraise them and to divine what they were&mdash;all in relation
to her.&nbsp; Then he had to talk, to hear what was said to him and
what was said back and forth, and to answer, when it was necessary,
with a tongue prone to looseness of speech that required a constant
curb.&nbsp; And to add confusion to confusion, there was the servant,
an unceasing menace, that appeared noiselessly at his shoulder, a dire
Sphinx that propounded puzzles and conundrums demanding instantaneous
solution.&nbsp; He was oppressed throughout the meal by the thought
of finger-bowls.&nbsp; Irrelevantly, insistently, scores of times, he
wondered when they would come on and what they looked like.&nbsp; He
had heard of such things, and now, sooner or later, somewhere in the
next few minutes, he would see them, sit at table with exalted beings
who used them&mdash;ay, and he would use them himself.&nbsp; And most
important of all, far down and yet always at the surface of his thought,
was the problem of how he should comport himself toward these persons.&nbsp;
What should his attitude be?&nbsp; He wrestled continually and anxiously
with the problem.&nbsp; There were cowardly suggestions that he should
make believe, assume a part; and there were still more cowardly suggestions
that warned him he would fail in such course, that his nature was not
fitted to live up to it, and that he would make a fool of himself.</p>
<p>It was during the first part of the dinner, struggling to decide
upon his attitude, that he was very quiet.&nbsp; He did not know that
his quietness was giving the lie to Arthur&rsquo;s words of the day
before, when that brother of hers had announced that he was going to
bring a wild man home to dinner and for them not to be alarmed, because
they would find him an interesting wild man.&nbsp; Martin Eden could
not have found it in him, just then, to believe that her brother could
be guilty of such treachery&mdash;especially when he had been the means
of getting this particular brother out of an unpleasant row.&nbsp; So
he sat at table, perturbed by his own unfitness and at the same time
charmed by all that went on about him.&nbsp; For the first time he realized
that eating was something more than a utilitarian function.&nbsp; He
was unaware of what he ate.&nbsp; It was merely food.&nbsp; He was feasting
his love of beauty at this table where eating was an aesthetic function.&nbsp;
It was an intellectual function, too.&nbsp; His mind was stirred.&nbsp;
He heard words spoken that were meaningless to him, and other words
that he had seen only in books and that no man or woman he had known
was of large enough mental caliber to pronounce.&nbsp; When he heard
such words dropping carelessly from the lips of the members of this
marvellous family, her family, he thrilled with delight.&nbsp; The romance,
and beauty, and high vigor of the books were coming true.&nbsp; He was
in that rare and blissful state wherein a man sees his dreams stalk
out from the crannies of fantasy and become fact.</p>
<p>Never had he been at such an altitude of living, and he kept himself
in the background, listening, observing, and pleasuring, replying in
reticent monosyllables, saying, &ldquo;Yes, miss,&rdquo; and &ldquo;No,
miss,&rdquo; to her, and &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; and &ldquo;No,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; to her mother.&nbsp; He curbed the impulse, arising
out of his sea-training, to say &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and &ldquo;No,
sir,&rdquo; to her brothers.&nbsp; He felt that it would be inappropriate
and a confession of inferiority on his part&mdash;which would never
do if he was to win to her.&nbsp; Also, it was a dictate of his pride.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he cried to himself, once; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just
as good as them, and if they do know lots that I don&rsquo;t, I could
learn &rsquo;m a few myself, all the same!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the next
moment, when she or her mother addressed him as &ldquo;Mr. Eden,&rdquo;
his aggressive pride was forgotten, and he was glowing and warm with
delight.&nbsp; He was a civilized man, that was what he was, shoulder
to shoulder, at dinner, with people he had read about in books.&nbsp;
He was in the books himself, adventuring through the printed pages of
bound volumes.</p>
<p>But while he belied Arthur&rsquo;s description, and appeared a gentle
lamb rather than a wild man, he was racking his brains for a course
of action.&nbsp; He was no gentle lamb, and the part of second fiddle
would never do for the high-pitched dominance of his nature.&nbsp; He
talked only when he had to, and then his speech was like his walk to
the table, filled with jerks and halts as he groped in his polyglot
vocabulary for words, debating over words he knew were fit but which
he feared he could not pronounce, rejecting other words he knew would
not be understood or would be raw and harsh.&nbsp; But all the time
he was oppressed by the consciousness that this carefulness of diction
was making a booby of him, preventing him from expressing what he had
in him.&nbsp; Also, his love of freedom chafed against the restriction
in much the same way his neck chafed against the starched fetter of
a collar.&nbsp; Besides, he was confident that he could not keep it
up.&nbsp; He was by nature powerful of thought and sensibility, and
the creative spirit was restive and urgent.&nbsp; He was swiftly mastered
by the concept or sensation in him that struggled in birth-throes to
receive expression and form, and then he forgot himself and where he
was, and the old words&mdash;the tools of speech he knew&mdash;slipped
out.</p>
<p>Once, he declined something from the servant who interrupted and
pestered at his shoulder, and he said, shortly and emphatically, &ldquo;Pew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the instant those at the table were keyed up and expectant, the
servant was smugly pleased, and he was wallowing in mortification.&nbsp;
But he recovered himself quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Kanaka for &lsquo;finish,&rsquo;&rdquo; he
explained, &ldquo;and it just come out naturally.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s spelt
p-a-u.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught her curious and speculative eyes fixed on his hands, and,
being in explanatory mood, he said:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just come down the Coast on one of the Pacific mail steamers.&nbsp;
She was behind time, an&rsquo; around the Puget Sound ports we worked
like niggers, storing cargo-mixed freight, if you know what that means.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s how the skin got knocked off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; she hastened to explain,
in turn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your hands seemed too small for your body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His cheeks were hot.&nbsp; He took it as an exposure of another of
his deficiencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said depreciatingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t
big enough to stand the strain.&nbsp; I can hit like a mule with my
arms and shoulders.&nbsp; They are too strong, an&rsquo; when I smash
a man on the jaw the hands get smashed, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not happy at what he had said.&nbsp; He was filled with disgust
at himself.&nbsp; He had loosed the guard upon his tongue and talked
about things that were not nice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was brave of you to help Arthur the way you did&mdash;and
you a stranger,&rdquo; she said tactfully, aware of his discomfiture
though not of the reason for it.</p>
<p>He, in turn, realized what she had done, and in the consequent warm
surge of gratefulness that overwhelmed him forgot his loose-worded tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; at all,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Any guy &rsquo;ud do it for another.&nbsp; That bunch of hoodlums
was lookin&rsquo; for trouble, an&rsquo; Arthur wasn&rsquo;t botherin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em none.&nbsp; They butted in on &rsquo;m, an&rsquo; then I butted
in on them an&rsquo; poked a few.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where some of the
skin off my hands went, along with some of the teeth of the gang.&nbsp;
I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; missed it for anything.&nbsp; When
I seen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, open-mouthed, on the verge of the pit of his own depravity
and utter worthlessness to breathe the same air she did.&nbsp; And while
Arthur took up the tale, for the twentieth time, of his adventure with
the drunken hoodlums on the ferry-boat and of how Martin Eden had rushed
in and rescued him, that individual, with frowning brows, meditated
upon the fool he had made of himself, and wrestled more determinedly
with the problem of how he should conduct himself toward these people.&nbsp;
He certainly had not succeeded so far.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t of their
tribe, and he couldn&rsquo;t talk their lingo, was the way he put it
to himself.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t fake being their kind.&nbsp; The
masquerade would fail, and besides, masquerade was foreign to his nature.&nbsp;
There was no room in him for sham or artifice.&nbsp; Whatever happened,
he must be real.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t talk their talk just yet, though
in time he would.&nbsp; Upon that he was resolved.&nbsp; But in the
meantime, talk he must, and it must be his own talk, toned down, of
course, so as to be comprehensible to them and so as not to shook them
too much.&nbsp; And furthermore, he wouldn&rsquo;t claim, not even by
tacit acceptance, to be familiar with anything that was unfamiliar.&nbsp;
In pursuance of this decision, when the two brothers, talking university
shop, had used &ldquo;trig&rdquo; several times, Martin Eden demanded:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is <i>trig</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trignometry,&rdquo; Norman said; &ldquo;a higher form of math.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is math?&rdquo; was the next question, which, somehow,
brought the laugh on Norman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mathematics, arithmetic,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>Martin Eden nodded.&nbsp; He had caught a glimpse of the apparently
illimitable vistas of knowledge.&nbsp; What he saw took on tangibility.&nbsp;
His abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form.&nbsp;
In the alchemy of his brain, trigonometry and mathematics and the whole
field of knowledge which they betokened were transmuted into so much
landscape.&nbsp; The vistas he saw were vistas of green foliage and
forest glades, all softly luminous or shot through with flashing lights.&nbsp;
In the distance, detail was veiled and blurred by a purple haze, but
behind this purple haze, he knew, was the glamour of the unknown, the
lure of romance.&nbsp; It was like wine to him.&nbsp; Here was adventure,
something to do with head and hand, a world to conquer&mdash;and straightway
from the back of his consciousness rushed the thought, <i>conquering,
to win to her, that lily-pale spirit sitting beside him</i>.</p>
<p>The glimmering vision was rent asunder and dissipated by Arthur,
who, all evening, had been trying to draw his wild man out.&nbsp; Martin
Eden remembered his decision.&nbsp; For the first time he became himself,
consciously and deliberately at first, but soon lost in the joy of creating
in making life as he knew it appear before his listeners&rsquo; eyes.&nbsp;
He had been a member of the crew of the smuggling schooner <i>Halcyon</i>
when she was captured by a revenue cutter.&nbsp; He saw with wide eyes,
and he could tell what he saw.&nbsp; He brought the pulsing sea before
them, and the men and the ships upon the sea.&nbsp; He communicated
his power of vision, till they saw with his eyes what he had seen.&nbsp;
He selected from the vast mass of detail with an artist&rsquo;s touch,
drawing pictures of life that glowed and burned with light and color,
injecting movement so that his listeners surged along with him on the
flood of rough eloquence, enthusiasm, and power.&nbsp; At times he shocked
them with the vividness of the narrative and his terms of speech, but
beauty always followed fast upon the heels of violence, and tragedy
was relieved by humor, by interpretations of the strange twists and
quirks of sailors&rsquo; minds.</p>
<p>And while he talked, the girl looked at him with startled eyes.&nbsp;
His fire warmed her.&nbsp; She wondered if she had been cold all her
days.&nbsp; She wanted to lean toward this burning, blazing man that
was like a volcano spouting forth strength, robustness, and health.&nbsp;
She felt that she must lean toward him, and resisted by an effort.&nbsp;
Then, too, there was the counter impulse to shrink away from him.&nbsp;
She was repelled by those lacerated hands, grimed by toil so that the
very dirt of life was ingrained in the flesh itself, by that red chafe
of the collar and those bulging muscles.&nbsp; His roughness frightened
her; each roughness of speech was an insult to her ear, each rough phase
of his life an insult to her soul.&nbsp; And ever and again would come
the draw of him, till she thought he must be evil to have such power
over her.&nbsp; All that was most firmly established in her mind was
rocking.&nbsp; His romance and adventure were battering at the conventions.&nbsp;
Before his facile perils and ready laugh, life was no longer an affair
of serious effort and restraint, but a toy, to be played with and turned
topsy-turvy, carelessly to be lived and pleasured in, and carelessly
to be flung aside.&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore, play!&rdquo; was the cry
that rang through her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lean toward him, if so you will,
and place your two hands upon his neck!&rdquo;&nbsp; She wanted to cry
out at the recklessness of the thought, and in vain she appraised her
own cleanness and culture and balanced all that she was against what
he was not.&nbsp; She glanced about her and saw the others gazing at
him with rapt attention; and she would have despaired had not she seen
horror in her mother&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;fascinated horror, it was true,
but none the less horror.&nbsp; This man from outer darkness was evil.&nbsp;
Her mother saw it, and her mother was right.&nbsp; She would trust her
mother&rsquo;s judgment in this as she had always trusted it in all
things.&nbsp; The fire of him was no longer warm, and the fear of him
was no longer poignant.</p>
<p>Later, at the piano, she played for him, and at him, aggressively,
with the vague intent of emphasizing the impassableness of the gulf
that separated them.&nbsp; Her music was a club that she swung brutally
upon his head; and though it stunned him and crushed him down, it incited
him.&nbsp; He gazed upon her in awe.&nbsp; In his mind, as in her own,
the gulf widened; but faster than it widened, towered his ambition to
win across it.&nbsp; But he was too complicated a plexus of sensibilities
to sit staring at a gulf a whole evening, especially when there was
music.&nbsp; He was remarkably susceptible to music.&nbsp; It was like
strong drink, firing him to audacities of feeling,&mdash;a drug that
laid hold of his imagination and went cloud-soaring through the sky.&nbsp;
It banished sordid fact, flooded his mind with beauty, loosed romance
and to its heels added wings.&nbsp; He did not understand the music
she played.&nbsp; It was different from the dance-hall piano-banging
and blatant brass bands he had heard.&nbsp; But he had caught hints
of such music from the books, and he accepted her playing largely on
faith, patiently waiting, at first, for the lifting measures of pronounced
and simple rhythm, puzzled because those measures were not long continued.&nbsp;
Just as he caught the swing of them and started, his imagination attuned
in flight, always they vanished away in a chaotic scramble of sounds
that was meaningless to him, and that dropped his imagination, an inert
weight, back to earth.</p>
<p>Once, it entered his mind that there was a deliberate rebuff in all
this.&nbsp; He caught her spirit of antagonism and strove to divine
the message that her hands pronounced upon the keys.&nbsp; Then he dismissed
the thought as unworthy and impossible, and yielded himself more freely
to the music.&nbsp; The old delightful condition began to be induced.&nbsp;
His feet were no longer clay, and his flesh became spirit; before his
eyes and behind his eyes shone a great glory; and then the scene before
him vanished and he was away, rocking over the world that was to him
a very dear world.&nbsp; The known and the unknown were commingled in
the dream-pageant that thronged his vision.&nbsp; He entered strange
ports of sun-washed lands, and trod market-places among barbaric peoples
that no man had ever seen.&nbsp; The scent of the spice islands was
in his nostrils as he had known it on warm, breathless nights at sea,
or he beat up against the southeast trades through long tropic days,
sinking palm-tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea behind and lifting
palm-tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea ahead.&nbsp; Swift as
thought the pictures came and went.&nbsp; One instant he was astride
a broncho and flying through the fairy-colored Painted Desert country;
the next instant he was gazing down through shimmering heat into the
whited sepulchre of Death Valley, or pulling an oar on a freezing ocean
where great ice islands towered and glistened in the sun.&nbsp; He lay
on a coral beach where the cocoanuts grew down to the mellow-sounding
surf.&nbsp; The hulk of an ancient wreck burned with blue fires, in
the light of which danced the <i>hula</i> dancers to the barbaric love-calls
of the singers, who chanted to tinkling <i>ukuleles</i> and rumbling
tom-toms.&nbsp; It was a sensuous, tropic night.&nbsp; In the background
a volcano crater was silhouetted against the stars.&nbsp; Overhead drifted
a pale crescent moon, and the Southern Cross burned low in the sky.</p>
<p>He was a harp; all life that he had known and that was his consciousness
was the strings; and the flood of music was a wind that poured against
those strings and set them vibrating with memories and dreams.&nbsp;
He did not merely feel.&nbsp; Sensation invested itself in form and
color and radiance, and what his imagination dared, it objectified in
some sublimated and magic way.&nbsp; Past, present, and future mingled;
and he went on oscillating across the broad, warm world, through high
adventure and noble deeds to Her&mdash;ay, and with her, winning her,
his arm about her, and carrying her on in flight through the empery
of his mind.</p>
<p>And she, glancing at him across her shoulder, saw something of all
this in his face.&nbsp; It was a transfigured face, with great shining
eyes that gazed beyond the veil of sound and saw behind it the leap
and pulse of life and the gigantic phantoms of the spirit.&nbsp; She
was startled.&nbsp; The raw, stumbling lout was gone.&nbsp; The ill-fitting
clothes, battered hands, and sunburned face remained; but these seemed
the prison-bars through which she saw a great soul looking forth, inarticulate
and dumb because of those feeble lips that would not give it speech.&nbsp;
Only for a flashing moment did she see this, then she saw the lout returned,
and she laughed at the whim of her fancy.&nbsp; But the impression of
that fleeting glimpse lingered, and when the time came for him to beat
a stumbling retreat and go, she lent him the volume of Swinburne, and
another of Browning&mdash;she was studying Browning in one of her English
courses.&nbsp; He seemed such a boy, as he stood blushing and stammering
his thanks, that a wave of pity, maternal in its prompting, welled up
in her.&nbsp; She did not remember the lout, nor the imprisoned soul,
nor the man who had stared at her in all masculineness and delighted
and frightened her.&nbsp; She saw before her only a boy, who was shaking
her hand with a hand so calloused that it felt like a nutmeg-grater
and rasped her skin, and who was saying jerkily:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greatest time of my life.&nbsp; You see, I ain&rsquo;t
used to things. . . &rdquo;&nbsp; He looked about him helplessly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To people and houses like this.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all new to me,
and I like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll call again,&rdquo; she said, as he was
saying good night to her brothers.</p>
<p>He pulled on his cap, lurched desperately through the doorway, and
was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of him?&rdquo; Arthur demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is most interesting, a whiff of ozone,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How old is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty&mdash;almost twenty-one.&nbsp; I asked him this afternoon.&nbsp;
I didn&rsquo;t think he was that young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I am three years older, was the thought in her mind as she kissed
her brothers goodnight.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>As Martin Eden went down the steps, his hand dropped into his coat
pocket.&nbsp; It came out with a brown rice paper and a pinch of Mexican
tobacco, which were deftly rolled together into a cigarette.&nbsp; He
drew the first whiff of smoke deep into his lungs and expelled it in
a long and lingering exhalation.&nbsp; &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he said
aloud, in a voice of awe and wonder.&nbsp; &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he
repeated.&nbsp; And yet again he murmured, &ldquo;By God!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then his hand went to his collar, which he ripped out of the shirt and
stuffed into his pocket.&nbsp; A cold drizzle was falling, but he bared
his head to it and unbuttoned his vest, swinging along in splendid unconcern.&nbsp;
He was only dimly aware that it was raining.&nbsp; He was in an ecstasy,
dreaming dreams and reconstructing the scenes just past.</p>
<p>He had met the woman at last&mdash;the woman that he had thought
little about, not being given to thinking about women, but whom he had
expected, in a remote way, he would sometime meet.&nbsp; He had sat
next to her at table.&nbsp; He had felt her hand in his, he had looked
into her eyes and caught a vision of a beautiful spirit;&mdash;but no
more beautiful than the eyes through which it shone, nor than the flesh
that gave it expression and form.&nbsp; He did not think of her flesh
as flesh,&mdash;which was new to him; for of the women he had known
that was the only way he thought.&nbsp; Her flesh was somehow different.&nbsp;
He did not conceive of her body as a body, subject to the ills and frailties
of bodies.&nbsp; Her body was more than the garb of her spirit.&nbsp;
It was an emanation of her spirit, a pure and gracious crystallization
of her divine essence.&nbsp; This feeling of the divine startled him.&nbsp;
It shocked him from his dreams to sober thought.&nbsp; No word, no clew,
no hint, of the divine had ever reached him before.&nbsp; He had never
believed in the divine.&nbsp; He had always been irreligious, scoffing
good-naturedly at the sky-pilots and their immortality of the soul.&nbsp;
There was no life beyond, he had contended; it was here and now, then
darkness everlasting.&nbsp; But what he had seen in her eyes was soul&mdash;immortal
soul that could never die.&nbsp; No man he had known, nor any woman,
had given him the message of immortality.&nbsp; But she had.&nbsp; She
had whispered it to him the first moment she looked at him.&nbsp; Her
face shimmered before his eyes as he walked along,&mdash;pale and serious,
sweet and sensitive, smiling with pity and tenderness as only a spirit
could smile, and pure as he had never dreamed purity could be.&nbsp;
Her purity smote him like a blow.&nbsp; It startled him.&nbsp; He had
known good and bad; but purity, as an attribute of existence, had never
entered his mind.&nbsp; And now, in her, he conceived purity to be the
superlative of goodness and of cleanness, the sum of which constituted
eternal life.</p>
<p>And promptly urged his ambition to grasp at eternal life.&nbsp; He
was not fit to carry water for her&mdash;he knew that; it was a miracle
of luck and a fantastic stroke that had enabled him to see her and be
with her and talk with her that night.&nbsp; It was accidental.&nbsp;
There was no merit in it.&nbsp; He did not deserve such fortune.&nbsp;
His mood was essentially religious.&nbsp; He was humble and meek, filled
with self-disparagement and abasement.&nbsp; In such frame of mind sinners
come to the penitent form.&nbsp; He was convicted of sin.&nbsp; But
as the meek and lowly at the penitent form catch splendid glimpses of
their future lordly existence, so did he catch similar glimpses of the
state he would gain to by possessing her.&nbsp; But this possession
of her was dim and nebulous and totally different from possession as
he had known it.&nbsp; Ambition soared on mad wings, and he saw himself
climbing the heights with her, sharing thoughts with her, pleasuring
in beautiful and noble things with her.&nbsp; It was a soul-possession
he dreamed, refined beyond any grossness, a free comradeship of spirit
that he could not put into definite thought.&nbsp; He did not think
it.&nbsp; For that matter, he did not think at all.&nbsp; Sensation
usurped reason, and he was quivering and palpitant with emotions he
had never known, drifting deliciously on a sea of sensibility where
feeling itself was exalted and spiritualized and carried beyond the
summits of life.</p>
<p>He staggered along like a drunken man, murmuring fervently aloud:
&ldquo;By God!&nbsp; By God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A policeman on a street corner eyed him suspiciously, then noted
his sailor roll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; the policeman demanded.</p>
<p>Martin Eden came back to earth.&nbsp; His was a fluid organism, swiftly
adjustable, capable of flowing into and filling all sorts of nooks and
crannies.&nbsp; With the policeman&rsquo;s hail he was immediately his
ordinary self, grasping the situation clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beaut, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he laughed back.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I was talkin&rsquo; out loud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be singing next,&rdquo; was the policeman&rsquo;s
diagnosis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Gimme a match an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
catch the next car home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lighted his cigarette, said good night, and went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
wouldn&rsquo;t that rattle you?&rdquo; he ejaculated under his breath.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That copper thought I was drunk.&rdquo;&nbsp; He smiled to himself
and meditated.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess I was,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;but
I didn&rsquo;t think a woman&rsquo;s face&rsquo;d do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught a Telegraph Avenue car that was going to Berkeley.&nbsp;
It was crowded with youths and young men who were singing songs and
ever and again barking out college yells.&nbsp; He studied them curiously.&nbsp;
They were university boys.&nbsp; They went to the same university that
she did, were in her class socially, could know her, could see her every
day if they wanted to.&nbsp; He wondered that they did not want to,
that they had been out having a good time instead of being with her
that evening, talking with her, sitting around her in a worshipful and
adoring circle.&nbsp; His thoughts wandered on.&nbsp; He noticed one
with narrow-slitted eyes and a loose-lipped mouth.&nbsp; That fellow
was vicious, he decided.&nbsp; On shipboard he would be a sneak, a whiner,
a tattler.&nbsp; He, Martin Eden, was a better man than that fellow.&nbsp;
The thought cheered him.&nbsp; It seemed to draw him nearer to Her.&nbsp;
He began comparing himself with the students.&nbsp; He grew conscious
of the muscled mechanism of his body and felt confident that he was
physically their master.&nbsp; But their heads were filled with knowledge
that enabled them to talk her talk,&mdash;the thought depressed him.&nbsp;
But what was a brain for? he demanded passionately.&nbsp; What they
had done, he could do.&nbsp; They had been studying about life from
the books while he had been busy living life.&nbsp; His brain was just
as full of knowledge as theirs, though it was a different kind of knowledge.&nbsp;
How many of them could tie a lanyard knot, or take a wheel or a lookout?&nbsp;
His life spread out before him in a series of pictures of danger and
daring, hardship and toil.&nbsp; He remembered his failures and scrapes
in the process of learning.&nbsp; He was that much to the good, anyway.&nbsp;
Later on they would have to begin living life and going through the
mill as he had gone.&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; While they were busy with
that, he could be learning the other side of life from the books.</p>
<p>As the car crossed the zone of scattered dwellings that separated
Oakland from Berkeley, he kept a lookout for a familiar, two-story building
along the front of which ran the proud sign, HIGGINBOTHAM&rsquo;S CASH
STORE.&nbsp; Martin Eden got off at this corner.&nbsp; He stared up
for a moment at the sign.&nbsp; It carried a message to him beyond its
mere wording.&nbsp; A personality of smallness and egotism and petty
underhandedness seemed to emanate from the letters themselves.&nbsp;
Bernard Higginbotham had married his sister, and he knew him well.&nbsp;
He let himself in with a latch-key and climbed the stairs to the second
floor.&nbsp; Here lived his brother-in-law.&nbsp; The grocery was below.&nbsp;
There was a smell of stale vegetables in the air.&nbsp; As he groped
his way across the hall he stumbled over a toy-cart, left there by one
of his numerous nephews and nieces, and brought up against a door with
a resounding bang.&nbsp; &ldquo;The pincher,&rdquo; was his thought;
&ldquo;too miserly to burn two cents&rsquo; worth of gas and save his
boarders&rsquo; necks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fumbled for the knob and entered a lighted room, where sat his
sister and Bernard Higginbotham.&nbsp; She was patching a pair of his
trousers, while his lean body was distributed over two chairs, his feet
dangling in dilapidated carpet-slippers over the edge of the second
chair.&nbsp; He glanced across the top of the paper he was reading,
showing a pair of dark, insincere, sharp-staring eyes.&nbsp; Martin
Eden never looked at him without experiencing a sense of repulsion.&nbsp;
What his sister had seen in the man was beyond him.&nbsp; The other
affected him as so much vermin, and always aroused in him an impulse
to crush him under his foot.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some day I&rsquo;ll beat the
face off of him,&rdquo; was the way he often consoled himself for enduring
the man&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp; The eyes, weasel-like and cruel, were
looking at him complainingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Martin demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Out with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had that door painted only last week,&rdquo; Mr. Higginbotham
half whined, half bullied; &ldquo;and you know what union wages are.&nbsp;
You should be more careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin had intended to reply, but he was struck by the hopelessness
of it.&nbsp; He gazed across the monstrous sordidness of soul to a chromo
on the wall.&nbsp; It surprised him.&nbsp; He had always liked it, but
it seemed that now he was seeing it for the first time.&nbsp; It was
cheap, that was what it was, like everything else in this house.&nbsp;
His mind went back to the house he had just left, and he saw, first,
the paintings, and next, Her, looking at him with melting sweetness
as she shook his hand at leaving.&nbsp; He forgot where he was and Bernard
Higginbotham&rsquo;s existence, till that gentleman demanded:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen a ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin came back and looked at the beady eyes, sneering, truculent,
cowardly, and there leaped into his vision, as on a screen, the same
eyes when their owner was making a sale in the store below&mdash;subservient
eyes, smug, and oily, and flattering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Martin answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I seen a ghost.&nbsp;
Good night.&nbsp; Good night, Gertrude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started to leave the room, tripping over a loose seam in the slatternly
carpet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bang the door,&rdquo; Mr. Higginbotham cautioned
him.</p>
<p>He felt the blood crawl in his veins, but controlled himself and
closed the door softly behind him.</p>
<p>Mr. Higginbotham looked at his wife exultantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s ben drinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he proclaimed in a hoarse
whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told you he would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head resignedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His eyes was pretty shiny,&rdquo; she confessed; &ldquo;and
he didn&rsquo;t have no collar, though he went away with one.&nbsp;
But mebbe he didn&rsquo;t have more&rsquo;n a couple of glasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t stand up straight,&rdquo; asserted her husband.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I watched him.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t walk across the floor
without stumblin&rsquo;.&nbsp; You heard &rsquo;m yourself almost fall
down in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it was over Alice&rsquo;s cart,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t see it in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Higginbotham&rsquo;s voice and wrath began to rise.&nbsp; All
day he effaced himself in the store, reserving for the evening, with
his family, the privilege of being himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you that precious brother of yours was drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was cold, sharp, and final, his lips stamping the enunciation
of each word like the die of a machine.&nbsp; His wife sighed and remained
silent.&nbsp; She was a large, stout woman, always dressed slatternly
and always tired from the burdens of her flesh, her work, and her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got it in him, I tell you, from his father,&rdquo;
Mr. Higginbotham went on accusingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll
croak in the gutter the same way.&nbsp; You know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded, sighed, and went on stitching.&nbsp; They were agreed
that Martin had come home drunk.&nbsp; They did not have it in their
souls to know beauty, or they would have known that those shining eyes
and that glowing face betokened youth&rsquo;s first vision of love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Settin&rsquo; a fine example to the children,&rdquo; Mr. Higginbotham
snorted, suddenly, in the silence for which his wife was responsible
and which he resented.&nbsp; Sometimes he almost wished she would oppose
him more.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he does it again, he&rsquo;s got to get out.&nbsp;
Understand!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t put up with his shinanigan&mdash;debotchin&rsquo;
innocent children with his boozing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Higginbotham liked
the word, which was a new one in his vocabulary, recently gleaned from
a newspaper column.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is, debotchin&rsquo;&mdash;there
ain&rsquo;t no other name for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still his wife sighed, shook her head sorrowfully, and stitched on.&nbsp;
Mr. Higginbotham resumed the newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he paid last week&rsquo;s board?&rdquo; he shot across
the top of the newspaper.</p>
<p>She nodded, then added, &ldquo;He still has some money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When is he goin&rsquo; to sea again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When his pay-day&rsquo;s spent, I guess,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He was over to San Francisco yesterday looking for a ship.&nbsp;
But he&rsquo;s got money, yet, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s particular about
the kind of ship he signs for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for a deck-swab like him to put on airs,&rdquo;
Mr. Higginbotham snorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Particular!&nbsp; Him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said something about a schooner that&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo;
ready to go off to some outlandish place to look for buried treasure,
that he&rsquo;d sail on her if his money held out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he only wanted to steady down, I&rsquo;d give him a job
drivin&rsquo; the wagon,&rdquo; her husband said, but with no trace
of benevolence in his voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife looked alarm and interrogation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit to-night.&nbsp; Is goin&rsquo; to work for Carruthers.&nbsp;
They paid &rsquo;m more&rsquo;n I could afford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you you&rsquo;d lose &rsquo;m,&rdquo; she cried out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He was worth more&rsquo;n you was giving him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, old woman,&rdquo; Higginbotham bullied, &ldquo;for
the thousandth time I&rsquo;ve told you to keep your nose out of the
business.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t tell you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she sniffled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tom
was a good boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her husband glared at her.&nbsp; This was
unqualified defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that brother of yours was worth his salt, he could take
the wagon,&rdquo; he snorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He pays his board, just the same,&rdquo; was the retort.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An&rsquo; he&rsquo;s my brother, an&rsquo; so long as he don&rsquo;t
owe you money you&rsquo;ve got no right to be jumping on him all the
time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got some feelings, if I have been married to
you for seven years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell &rsquo;m you&rsquo;d charge him for gas if he
goes on readin&rsquo; in bed?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Mrs. Higginbotham made no reply.&nbsp; Her revolt faded away, her
spirit wilting down into her tired flesh.&nbsp; Her husband was triumphant.&nbsp;
He had her.&nbsp; His eyes snapped vindictively, while his ears joyed
in the sniffles she emitted.&nbsp; He extracted great happiness from
squelching her, and she squelched easily these days, though it had been
different in the first years of their married life, before the brood
of children and his incessant nagging had sapped her energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you tell &rsquo;m to-morrow, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; I just want to tell you, before I forget
it, that you&rsquo;d better send for Marian to-morrow to take care of
the children.&nbsp; With Tom quit, I&rsquo;ll have to be out on the
wagon, an&rsquo; you can make up your mind to it to be down below waitin&rsquo;
on the counter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to-morrow&rsquo;s wash day,&rdquo; she objected weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up early, then, an&rsquo; do it first.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
start out till ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crinkled the paper viciously and resumed his reading.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>Martin Eden, with blood still crawling from contact with his brother-in-law,
felt his way along the unlighted back hall and entered his room, a tiny
cubbyhole with space for a bed, a wash-stand, and one chair.&nbsp; Mr.
Higginbotham was too thrifty to keep a servant when his wife could do
the work.&nbsp; Besides, the servant&rsquo;s room enabled them to take
in two boarders instead of one.&nbsp; Martin placed the Swinburne and
Browning on the chair, took off his coat, and sat down on the bed.&nbsp;
A screeching of asthmatic springs greeted the weight of his body, but
he did not notice them.&nbsp; He started to take off his shoes, but
fell to staring at the white plaster wall opposite him, broken by long
streaks of dirty brown where rain had leaked through the roof.&nbsp;
On this befouled background visions began to flow and burn.&nbsp; He
forgot his shoes and stared long, till his lips began to move and he
murmured, &ldquo;Ruth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had not thought a simple sound could
be so beautiful.&nbsp; It delighted his ear, and he grew intoxicated
with the repetition of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ruth.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a
talisman, a magic word to conjure with.&nbsp; Each time he murmured
it, her face shimmered before him, suffusing the foul wall with a golden
radiance.&nbsp; This radiance did not stop at the wall.&nbsp; It extended
on into infinity, and through its golden depths his soul went questing
after hers.&nbsp; The best that was in him was out in splendid flood.&nbsp;
The very thought of her ennobled and purified him, made him better,
and made him want to be better.&nbsp; This was new to him.&nbsp; He
had never known women who had made him better.&nbsp; They had always
had the counter effect of making him beastly.&nbsp; He did not know
that many of them had done their best, bad as it was.&nbsp; Never having
been conscious of himself, he did not know that he had that in his being
that drew love from women and which had been the cause of their reaching
out for his youth.&nbsp; Though they had often bothered him, he had
never bothered about them; and he would never have dreamed that there
were women who had been better because of him.&nbsp; Always in sublime
carelessness had he lived, till now, and now it seemed to him that they
had always reached out and dragged at him with vile hands.&nbsp; This
was not just to them, nor to himself.&nbsp; But he, who for the first
time was becoming conscious of himself, was in no condition to judge,
and he burned with shame as he stared at the vision of his infamy.</p>
<p>He got up abruptly and tried to see himself in the dirty looking-glass
over the wash-stand.&nbsp; He passed a towel over it and looked again,
long and carefully.&nbsp; It was the first time he had ever really seen
himself.&nbsp; His eyes were made for seeing, but up to that moment
they had been filled with the ever changing panorama of the world, at
which he had been too busy gazing, ever to gaze at himself.&nbsp; He
saw the head and face of a young fellow of twenty, but, being unused
to such appraisement, he did not know how to value it.&nbsp; Above a
square-domed forehead he saw a mop of brown hair, nut-brown, with a
wave to it and hints of curls that were a delight to any woman, making
hands tingle to stroke it and fingers tingle to pass caresses through
it.&nbsp; But he passed it by as without merit, in Her eyes, and dwelt
long and thoughtfully on the high, square forehead,&mdash;striving to
penetrate it and learn the quality of its content.&nbsp; What kind of
a brain lay behind there? was his insistent interrogation.&nbsp; What
was it capable of?&nbsp; How far would it take him?&nbsp; Would it take
him to her?</p>
<p>He wondered if there was soul in those steel-gray eyes that were
often quite blue of color and that were strong with the briny airs of
the sun-washed deep.&nbsp; He wondered, also, how his eyes looked to
her.&nbsp; He tried to imagine himself she, gazing into those eyes of
his, but failed in the jugglery.&nbsp; He could successfully put himself
inside other men&rsquo;s minds, but they had to be men whose ways of
life he knew.&nbsp; He did not know her way of life.&nbsp; She was wonder
and mystery, and how could he guess one thought of hers?&nbsp; Well,
they were honest eyes, he concluded, and in them was neither smallness
nor meanness.&nbsp; The brown sunburn of his face surprised him.&nbsp;
He had not dreamed he was so black.&nbsp; He rolled up his shirt-sleeve
and compared the white underside if the arm with his face.&nbsp; Yes,
he was a white man, after all.&nbsp; But the arms were sunburned, too.&nbsp;
He twisted his arm, rolled the biceps over with his other hand, and
gazed underneath where he was least touched by the sun.&nbsp; It was
very white.&nbsp; He laughed at his bronzed face in the glass at the
thought that it was once as white as the underside of his arm; nor did
he dream that in the world there were few pale spirits of women who
could boast fairer or smoother skins than he&mdash;fairer than where
he had escaped the ravages of the sun.</p>
<p>His might have been a cherub&rsquo;s mouth, had not the full, sensuous
lips a trick, under stress, of drawing firmly across the teeth.&nbsp;
At times, so tightly did they draw, the mouth became stern and harsh,
even ascetic.&nbsp; They were the lips of a fighter and of a lover.&nbsp;
They could taste the sweetness of life with relish, and they could put
the sweetness aside and command life.&nbsp; The chin and jaw, strong
and just hinting of square aggressiveness, helped the lips to command
life.&nbsp; Strength balanced sensuousness and had upon it a tonic effect,
compelling him to love beauty that was healthy and making him vibrate
to sensations that were wholesome.&nbsp; And between the lips were teeth
that had never known nor needed the dentist&rsquo;s care.&nbsp; They
were white and strong and regular, he decided, as he looked at them.&nbsp;
But as he looked, he began to be troubled.&nbsp; Somewhere, stored away
in the recesses of his mind and vaguely remembered, was the impression
that there were people who washed their teeth every day.&nbsp; They
were the people from up above&mdash;people in her class.&nbsp; She must
wash her teeth every day, too.&nbsp; What would she think if she learned
that he had never washed his teeth in all the days of his life?&nbsp;
He resolved to get a tooth-brush and form the habit.&nbsp; He would
begin at once, to-morrow.&nbsp; It was not by mere achievement that
he could hope to win to her.&nbsp; He must make a personal reform in
all things, even to tooth-washing and neck-gear, though a starched collar
affected him as a renunciation of freedom.</p>
<p>He held up his hand, rubbing the ball of the thumb over the calloused
palm and gazing at the dirt that was ingrained in the flesh itself and
which no brush could scrub away.&nbsp; How different was her palm!&nbsp;
He thrilled deliciously at the remembrance.&nbsp; Like a rose-petal,
he thought; cool and soft as a snowflake.&nbsp; He had never thought
that a mere woman&rsquo;s hand could be so sweetly soft.&nbsp; He caught
himself imagining the wonder of a caress from such a hand, and flushed
guiltily.&nbsp; It was too gross a thought for her.&nbsp; In ways it
seemed to impugn her high spirituality.&nbsp; She was a pale, slender
spirit, exalted far beyond the flesh; but nevertheless the softness
of her palm persisted in his thoughts.&nbsp; He was used to the harsh
callousness of factory girls and working women.&nbsp; Well he knew why
their hands were rough; but this hand of hers . . . It was soft because
she had never used it to work with.&nbsp; The gulf yawned between her
and him at the awesome thought of a person who did not have to work
for a living.&nbsp; He suddenly saw the aristocracy of the people who
did not labor.&nbsp; It towered before him on the wall, a figure in
brass, arrogant and powerful.&nbsp; He had worked himself; his first
memories seemed connected with work, and all his family had worked.&nbsp;
There was Gertrude.&nbsp; When her hands were not hard from the endless
housework, they were swollen and red like boiled beef, what of the washing.&nbsp;
And there was his sister Marian.&nbsp; She had worked in the cannery
the preceding summer, and her slim, pretty hands were all scarred with
the tomato-knives.&nbsp; Besides, the tips of two of her fingers had
been left in the cutting machine at the paper-box factory the preceding
winter.&nbsp; He remembered the hard palms of his mother as she lay
in her coffin.&nbsp; And his father had worked to the last fading gasp;
the horned growth on his hands must have been half an inch thick when
he died.&nbsp; But Her hands were soft, and her mother&rsquo;s hands,
and her brothers&rsquo;.&nbsp; This last came to him as a surprise;
it was tremendously indicative of the highness of their caste, of the
enormous distance that stretched between her and him.</p>
<p>He sat back on the bed with a bitter laugh, and finished taking off
his shoes.&nbsp; He was a fool; he had been made drunken by a woman&rsquo;s
face and by a woman&rsquo;s soft, white hands.&nbsp; And then, suddenly,
before his eyes, on the foul plaster-wall appeared a vision.&nbsp; He
stood in front of a gloomy tenement house.&nbsp; It was night-time,
in the East End of London, and before him stood Margey, a little factory
girl of fifteen.&nbsp; He had seen her home after the bean-feast.&nbsp;
She lived in that gloomy tenement, a place not fit for swine.&nbsp;
His hand was going out to hers as he said good night.&nbsp; She had
put her lips up to be kissed, but he wasn&rsquo;t going to kiss her.&nbsp;
Somehow he was afraid of her.&nbsp; And then her hand closed on his
and pressed feverishly.&nbsp; He felt her callouses grind and grate
on his, and a great wave of pity welled over him.&nbsp; He saw her yearning,
hungry eyes, and her ill-fed female form which had been rushed from
childhood into a frightened and ferocious maturity; then he put his
arms about her in large tolerance and stooped and kissed her on the
lips.&nbsp; Her glad little cry rang in his ears, and he felt her clinging
to him like a cat.&nbsp; Poor little starveling!&nbsp; He continued
to stare at the vision of what had happened in the long ago.&nbsp; His
flesh was crawling as it had crawled that night when she clung to him,
and his heart was warm with pity.&nbsp; It was a gray scene, greasy
gray, and the rain drizzled greasily on the pavement stones.&nbsp; And
then a radiant glory shone on the wall, and up through the other vision,
displacing it, glimmered Her pale face under its crown of golden hair,
remote and inaccessible as a star.</p>
<p>He took the Browning and the Swinburne from the chair and kissed
them.&nbsp; Just the same, she told me to call again, he thought.&nbsp;
He took another look at himself in the glass, and said aloud, with great
solemnity:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin Eden, the first thing to-morrow you go to the free
library an&rsquo; read up on etiquette.&nbsp; Understand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned off the gas, and the springs shrieked under his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got to quit cussin&rsquo;, Martin, old boy;
you&rsquo;ve got to quit cussin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said aloud.</p>
<p>Then he dozed off to sleep and to dream dreams that for madness and
audacity rivalled those of poppy-eaters.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>He awoke next morning from rosy scenes of dream to a steamy atmosphere
that smelled of soapsuds and dirty clothes, and that was vibrant with
the jar and jangle of tormented life.&nbsp; As he came out of his room
he heard the slosh of water, a sharp exclamation, and a resounding smack
as his sister visited her irritation upon one of her numerous progeny.&nbsp;
The squall of the child went through him like a knife.&nbsp; He was
aware that the whole thing, the very air he breathed, was repulsive
and mean.&nbsp; How different, he thought, from the atmosphere of beauty
and repose of the house wherein Ruth dwelt.&nbsp; There it was all spiritual.&nbsp;
Here it was all material, and meanly material.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Alfred,&rdquo; he called to the crying child, at
the same time thrusting his hand into his trousers pocket, where he
carried his money loose in the same large way that he lived life in
general.&nbsp; He put a quarter in the youngster&rsquo;s hand and held
him in his arms a moment, soothing his sobs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now run along
and get some candy, and don&rsquo;t forget to give some to your brothers
and sisters.&nbsp; Be sure and get the kind that lasts longest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His sister lifted a flushed face from the wash-tub and looked at
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nickel&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; ben enough,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like you, no idea of the value of money.&nbsp;
The child&rsquo;ll eat himself sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, sis,&rdquo; he answered jovially.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My money&rsquo;ll take care of itself.&nbsp; If you weren&rsquo;t
so busy, I&rsquo;d kiss you good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wanted to be affectionate to this sister, who was good, and who,
in her way, he knew, loved him.&nbsp; But, somehow, she grew less herself
as the years went by, and more and more baffling.&nbsp; It was the hard
work, the many children, and the nagging of her husband, he decided,
that had changed her.&nbsp; It came to him, in a flash of fancy, that
her nature seemed taking on the attributes of stale vegetables, smelly
soapsuds, and of the greasy dimes, nickels, and quarters she took in
over the counter of the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go along an&rsquo; get your breakfast,&rdquo; she said roughly,
though secretly pleased.&nbsp; Of all her wandering brood of brothers
he had always been her favorite.&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare I <i>will</i>
kiss you,&rdquo; she said, with a sudden stir at her heart.</p>
<p>With thumb and forefinger she swept the dripping suds first from
one arm and then from the other.&nbsp; He put his arms round her massive
waist and kissed her wet steamy lips. The tears welled into her eyes&mdash;not
so much from strength of feeling as from the weakness of chronic overwork.&nbsp;
She shoved him away from her, but not before he caught a glimpse of
her moist eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find breakfast in the oven,&rdquo; she said hurriedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jim ought to be up now.&nbsp; I had to get up early for the washing.&nbsp;
Now get along with you and get out of the house early.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t
be nice to-day, what of Tom quittin&rsquo; an&rsquo; nobody but Bernard
to drive the wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin went into the kitchen with a sinking heart, the image of her
red face and slatternly form eating its way like acid into his brain.&nbsp;
She might love him if she only had some time, he concluded.&nbsp; But
she was worked to death.&nbsp; Bernard Higginbotham was a brute to work
her so hard.&nbsp; But he could not help but feel, on the other hand,
that there had not been anything beautiful in that kiss.&nbsp; It was
true, it was an unusual kiss.&nbsp; For years she had kissed him only
when he returned from voyages or departed on voyages. But this kiss
had tasted soapsuds, and the lips, he had noticed, were flabby.&nbsp;
There had been no quick, vigorous lip-pressure such as should accompany
any kiss.&nbsp; Hers was the kiss of a tired woman who had been tired
so long that she had forgotten how to kiss.&nbsp; He remembered her
as a girl, before her marriage, when she would dance with the best,
all night, after a hard day&rsquo;s work at the laundry, and think nothing
of leaving the dance to go to another day&rsquo;s hard work.&nbsp; And
then he thought of Ruth and the cool sweetness that must reside in her
lips as it resided in all about her.&nbsp; Her kiss would be like her
hand-shake or the way she looked at one, firm and frank.&nbsp; In imagination
he dared to think of her lips on his, and so vividly did he imagine
that he went dizzy at the thought and seemed to rift through clouds
of rose-petals, filling his brain with their perfume.</p>
<p>In the kitchen he found Jim, the other boarder, eating mush very
languidly, with a sick, far-away look in his eyes.&nbsp; Jim was a plumber&rsquo;s
apprentice whose weak chin and hedonistic temperament, coupled with
a certain nervous stupidity, promised to take him nowhere in the race
for bread and butter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you eat?&rdquo; he demanded, as Martin dipped
dolefully into the cold, half-cooked oatmeal mush.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was
you drunk again last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin shook his head.&nbsp; He was oppressed by the utter squalidness
of it all.&nbsp; Ruth Morse seemed farther removed than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; Jim went on with a boastful, nervous giggle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was loaded right to the neck.&nbsp; Oh, she was a daisy.&nbsp;
Billy brought me home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin nodded that he heard,&mdash;it was a habit of nature with
him to pay heed to whoever talked to him,&mdash;and poured a cup of
lukewarm coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to the Lotus Club dance to-night?&rdquo; Jim demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to have beer, an&rsquo; if that Temescal
bunch comes, there&rsquo;ll be a rough-house.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care,
though.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; my lady friend just the same.&nbsp;
Cripes, but I&rsquo;ve got a taste in my mouth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a wry face and attempted to wash the taste away with coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye know Julia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my lady friend,&rdquo; Jim explained, &ldquo;and
she&rsquo;s a peach.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d introduce you to her, only you&rsquo;d
win her.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see what the girls see in you, honest I
don&rsquo;t; but the way you win them away from the fellers is sickenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never got any away from you,&rdquo; Martin answered uninterestedly.&nbsp;
The breakfast had to be got through somehow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you did, too,&rdquo; the other asserted warmly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There was Maggie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never had anything to do with her.&nbsp; Never danced with
her except that one night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s just what did it,&rdquo; Jim cried
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;You just danced with her an&rsquo; looked at her,
an&rsquo; it was all off.&nbsp; Of course you didn&rsquo;t mean nothin&rsquo;
by it, but it settled me for keeps.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t look at me
again.&nbsp; Always askin&rsquo; about you.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d have made
fast dates enough with you if you&rsquo;d wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t necessary.&nbsp; I was left at the pole.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Jim looked at him admiringly.&nbsp; &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do it, anyway,
Mart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By not carin&rsquo; about &rsquo;em,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean makin&rsquo; b&rsquo;lieve you don&rsquo;t care about
them?&rdquo; Jim queried eagerly.</p>
<p>Martin considered for a moment, then answered, &ldquo;Perhaps that
will do, but with me I guess it&rsquo;s different.&nbsp; I never have
cared&mdash;much.&nbsp; If you can put it on, it&rsquo;s all right,
most likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should &rsquo;a&rsquo; ben up at Riley&rsquo;s barn last
night,&rdquo; Jim announced inconsequently.&nbsp; &ldquo;A lot of the
fellers put on the gloves.&nbsp; There was a peach from West Oakland.&nbsp;
They called &rsquo;m &lsquo;The Rat.&rsquo;&nbsp; Slick as silk.&nbsp;
No one could touch &rsquo;m.&nbsp; We was all wishin&rsquo; you was
there.&nbsp; Where was you anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down in Oakland,&rdquo; Martin replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin shoved his plate away and got up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comin&rsquo; to the dance to-night?&rdquo; the other called
after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think not,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>He went downstairs and out into the street, breathing great breaths
of air.&nbsp; He had been suffocating in that atmosphere, while the
apprentice&rsquo;s chatter had driven him frantic.&nbsp; There had been
times when it was all he could do to refrain from reaching over and
mopping Jim&rsquo;s face in the mush-plate.&nbsp; The more he had chattered,
the more remote had Ruth seemed to him.&nbsp; How could he, herding
with such cattle, ever become worthy of her?&nbsp; He was appalled at
the problem confronting him, weighted down by the incubus of his working-class
station.&nbsp; Everything reached out to hold him down&mdash;his sister,
his sister&rsquo;s house and family, Jim the apprentice, everybody he
knew, every tie of life.&nbsp; Existence did not taste good in his mouth.&nbsp;
Up to then he had accepted existence, as he had lived it with all about
him, as a good thing.&nbsp; He had never questioned it, except when
he read books; but then, they were only books, fairy stories of a fairer
and impossible world.&nbsp; But now he had seen that world, possible
and real, with a flower of a woman called Ruth in the midmost centre
of it; and thenceforth he must know bitter tastes, and longings sharp
as pain, and hopelessness that tantalized because it fed on hope.</p>
<p>He had debated between the Berkeley Free Library and the Oakland
Free Library, and decided upon the latter because Ruth lived in Oakland.&nbsp;
Who could tell?&mdash;a library was a most likely place for her, and
he might see her there.&nbsp; He did not know the way of libraries,
and he wandered through endless rows of fiction, till the delicate-featured
French-looking girl who seemed in charge, told him that the reference
department was upstairs.&nbsp; He did not know enough to ask the man
at the desk, and began his adventures in the philosophy alcove.&nbsp;
He had heard of book philosophy, but had not imagined there had been
so much written about it.&nbsp; The high, bulging shelves of heavy tomes
humbled him and at the same time stimulated him.&nbsp; Here was work
for the vigor of his brain.&nbsp; He found books on trigonometry in
the mathematics section, and ran the pages, and stared at the meaningless
formulas and figures.&nbsp; He could read English, but he saw there
an alien speech.&nbsp; Norman and Arthur knew that speech.&nbsp; He
had heard them talking it.&nbsp; And they were her brothers.&nbsp; He
left the alcove in despair.&nbsp; From every side the books seemed to
press upon him and crush him.</p>
<p>He had never dreamed that the fund of human knowledge bulked so big.&nbsp;
He was frightened.&nbsp; How could his brain ever master it all?&nbsp;
Later, he remembered that there were other men, many men, who had mastered
it; and he breathed a great oath, passionately, under his breath, swearing
that his brain could do what theirs had done.</p>
<p>And so he wandered on, alternating between depression and elation
as he stared at the shelves packed with wisdom.&nbsp; In one miscellaneous
section he came upon a &ldquo;Norrie&rsquo;s Epitome.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
turned the pages reverently.&nbsp; In a way, it spoke a kindred speech.&nbsp;
Both he and it were of the sea.&nbsp; Then he found a &ldquo;Bowditch&rdquo;
and books by Lecky and Marshall.&nbsp; There it was; he would teach
himself navigation.&nbsp; He would quit drinking, work up, and become
a captain.&nbsp; Ruth seemed very near to him in that moment.&nbsp;
As a captain, he could marry her (if she would have him).&nbsp; And
if she wouldn&rsquo;t, well&mdash;he would live a good life among men,
because of Her, and he would quit drinking anyway.&nbsp; Then he remembered
the underwriters and the owners, the two masters a captain must serve,
either of which could and would break him and whose interests were diametrically
opposed.&nbsp; He cast his eyes about the room and closed the lids down
on a vision of ten thousand books.&nbsp; No; no more of the sea for
him.&nbsp; There was power in all that wealth of books, and if he would
do great things, he must do them on the land.&nbsp; Besides, captains
were not allowed to take their wives to sea with them.</p>
<p>Noon came, and afternoon.&nbsp; He forgot to eat, and sought on for
the books on etiquette; for, in addition to career, his mind was vexed
by a simple and very concrete problem: <i>When you meet a young lady
and she asks you to call, how soon can you call</i>? was the way he
worded it to himself.&nbsp; But when he found the right shelf, he sought
vainly for the answer.&nbsp; He was appalled at the vast edifice of
etiquette, and lost himself in the mazes of visiting-card conduct between
persons in polite society.&nbsp; He abandoned his search.&nbsp; He had
not found what he wanted, though he had found that it would take all
of a man&rsquo;s time to be polite, and that he would have to live a
preliminary life in which to learn how to be polite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find what you wanted?&rdquo; the man at the desk asked
him as he was leaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have a fine
library here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;We should be glad to see you here often.&nbsp;
Are you a sailor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll
come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, how did he know that? he asked himself as he went down the stairs.</p>
<p>And for the first block along the street he walked very stiff and
straight and awkwardly, until he forgot himself in his thoughts, whereupon
his rolling gait gracefully returned to him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>A terrible restlessness that was akin to hunger afflicted Martin
Eden.&nbsp; He was famished for a sight of the girl whose slender hands
had gripped his life with a giant&rsquo;s grasp.&nbsp; He could not
steel himself to call upon her.&nbsp; He was afraid that he might call
too soon, and so be guilty of an awful breach of that awful thing called
etiquette.&nbsp; He spent long hours in the Oakland and Berkeley libraries,
and made out application blanks for membership for himself, his sisters
Gertrude and Marian, and Jim, the latter&rsquo;s consent being obtained
at the expense of several glasses of beer.&nbsp; With four cards permitting
him to draw books, he burned the gas late in the servant&rsquo;s room,
and was charged fifty cents a week for it by Mr. Higginbotham.</p>
<p>The many books he read but served to whet his unrest.&nbsp; Every
page of every book was a peep-hole into the realm of knowledge.&nbsp;
His hunger fed upon what he read, and increased.&nbsp; Also, he did
not know where to begin, and continually suffered from lack of preparation.&nbsp;
The commonest references, that he could see plainly every reader was
expected to know, he did not know.&nbsp; And the same was true of the
poetry he read which maddened him with delight.&nbsp; He read more of
Swinburne than was contained in the volume Ruth had lent him; and &ldquo;Dolores&rdquo;
he understood thoroughly.&nbsp; But surely Ruth did not understand it,
he concluded.&nbsp; How could she, living the refined life she did?&nbsp;
Then he chanced upon Kipling&rsquo;s poems, and was swept away by the
lilt and swing and glamour with which familiar things had been invested.&nbsp;
He was amazed at the man&rsquo;s sympathy with life and at his incisive
psychology.&nbsp; <i>Psychology</i> was a new word in Martin&rsquo;s
vocabulary.&nbsp; He had bought a dictionary, which deed had decreased
his supply of money and brought nearer the day on which he must sail
in search of more.&nbsp; Also, it incensed Mr. Higginbotham, who would
have preferred the money taking the form of board.</p>
<p>He dared not go near Ruth&rsquo;s neighborhood in the daytime, but
night found him lurking like a thief around the Morse home, stealing
glimpses at the windows and loving the very walls that sheltered her.&nbsp;
Several times he barely escaped being caught by her brothers, and once
he trailed Mr. Morse down town and studied his face in the lighted streets,
longing all the while for some quick danger of death to threaten so
that he might spring in and save her father.&nbsp; On another night,
his vigil was rewarded by a glimpse of Ruth through a second-story window.&nbsp;
He saw only her head and shoulders, and her arms raised as she fixed
her hair before a mirror.&nbsp; It was only for a moment, but it was
a long moment to him, during which his blood turned to wine and sang
through his veins.&nbsp; Then she pulled down the shade.&nbsp; But it
was her room&mdash;he had learned that; and thereafter he strayed there
often, hiding under a dark tree on the opposite side of the street and
smoking countless cigarettes.&nbsp; One afternoon he saw her mother
coming out of a bank, and received another proof of the enormous distance
that separated Ruth from him.&nbsp; She was of the class that dealt
with banks.&nbsp; He had never been inside a bank in his life, and he
had an idea that such institutions were frequented only by the very
rich and the very powerful.</p>
<p>In one way, he had undergone a moral revolution.&nbsp; Her cleanness
and purity had reacted upon him, and he felt in his being a crying need
to be clean.&nbsp; He must be that if he were ever to be worthy of breathing
the same air with her.&nbsp; He washed his teeth, and scrubbed his hands
with a kitchen scrub-brush till he saw a nail-brush in a drug-store
window and divined its use.&nbsp; While purchasing it, the clerk glanced
at his nails, suggested a nail-file, and so he became possessed of an
additional toilet-tool.&nbsp; He ran across a book in the library on
the care of the body, and promptly developed a penchant for a cold-water
bath every morning, much to the amazement of Jim, and to the bewilderment
of Mr. Higginbotham, who was not in sympathy with such high-fangled
notions and who seriously debated whether or not he should charge Martin
extra for the water.&nbsp; Another stride was in the direction of creased
trousers.&nbsp; Now that Martin was aroused in such matters, he swiftly
noted the difference between the baggy knees of the trousers worn by
the working class and the straight line from knee to foot of those worn
by the men above the working class.&nbsp; Also, he learned the reason
why, and invaded his sister&rsquo;s kitchen in search of irons and ironing-board.&nbsp;
He had misadventures at first, hopelessly burning one pair and buying
another, which expenditure again brought nearer the day on which he
must put to sea.</p>
<p>But the reform went deeper than mere outward appearance.&nbsp; He
still smoked, but he drank no more.&nbsp; Up to that time, drinking
had seemed to him the proper thing for men to do, and he had prided
himself on his strong head which enabled him to drink most men under
the table.&nbsp; Whenever he encountered a chance shipmate, and there
were many in San Francisco, he treated them and was treated in turn,
as of old, but he ordered for himself root beer or ginger ale and good-naturedly
endured their chaffing.&nbsp; And as they waxed maudlin he studied them,
watching the beast rise and master them and thanking God that he was
no longer as they.&nbsp; They had their limitations to forget, and when
they were drunk, their dim, stupid spirits were even as gods, and each
ruled in his heaven of intoxicated desire.&nbsp; With Martin the need
for strong drink had vanished.&nbsp; He was drunken in new and more
profound ways&mdash;with Ruth, who had fired him with love and with
a glimpse of higher and eternal life; with books, that had set a myriad
maggots of desire gnawing in his brain; and with the sense of personal
cleanliness he was achieving, that gave him even more superb health
than what he had enjoyed and that made his whole body sing with physical
well-being.</p>
<p>One night he went to the theatre, on the blind chance that he might
see her there, and from the second balcony he did see her.&nbsp; He
saw her come down the aisle, with Arthur and a strange young man with
a football mop of hair and eyeglasses, the sight of whom spurred him
to instant apprehension and jealousy.&nbsp; He saw her take her seat
in the orchestra circle, and little else than her did he see that night&mdash;a
pair of slender white shoulders and a mass of pale gold hair, dim with
distance.&nbsp; But there were others who saw, and now and again, glancing
at those about him, he noted two young girls who looked back from the
row in front, a dozen seats along, and who smiled at him with bold eyes.&nbsp;
He had always been easy-going.&nbsp; It was not in his nature to give
rebuff.&nbsp; In the old days he would have smiled back, and gone further
and encouraged smiling.&nbsp; But now it was different.&nbsp; He did
smile back, then looked away, and looked no more deliberately.&nbsp;
But several times, forgetting the existence of the two girls, his eyes
caught their smiles.&nbsp; He could not re-thumb himself in a day, nor
could he violate the intrinsic kindliness of his nature; so, at such
moments, he smiled at the girls in warm human friendliness.&nbsp; It
was nothing new to him.&nbsp; He knew they were reaching out their woman&rsquo;s
hands to him.&nbsp; But it was different now.&nbsp; Far down there in
the orchestra circle was the one woman in all the world, so different,
so terrifically different, from these two girls of his class, that he
could feel for them only pity and sorrow.&nbsp; He had it in his heart
to wish that they could possess, in some small measure, her goodness
and glory.&nbsp; And not for the world could he hurt them because of
their outreaching.&nbsp; He was not flattered by it; he even felt a
slight shame at his lowliness that permitted it.&nbsp; He knew, did
he belong in Ruth&rsquo;s class, that there would be no overtures from
these girls; and with each glance of theirs he felt the fingers of his
own class clutching at him to hold him down.</p>
<p>He left his seat before the curtain went down on the last act, intent
on seeing Her as she passed out.&nbsp; There were always numbers of
men who stood on the sidewalk outside, and he could pull his cap down
over his eyes and screen himself behind some one&rsquo;s shoulder so
that she should not see him.&nbsp; He emerged from the theatre with
the first of the crowd; but scarcely had he taken his position on the
edge of the sidewalk when the two girls appeared.&nbsp; They were looking
for him, he knew; and for the moment he could have cursed that in him
which drew women.&nbsp; Their casual edging across the sidewalk to the
curb, as they drew near, apprised him of discovery.&nbsp; They slowed
down, and were in the thick of the crown as they came up with him.&nbsp;
One of them brushed against him and apparently for the first time noticed
him.&nbsp; She was a slender, dark girl, with black, defiant eyes.&nbsp;
But they smiled at him, and he smiled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>It was automatic; he had said it so often before under similar circumstances
of first meetings.&nbsp; Besides, he could do no less.&nbsp; There was
that large tolerance and sympathy in his nature that would permit him
to do no less.&nbsp; The black-eyed girl smiled gratification and greeting,
and showed signs of stopping, while her companion, arm linked in arm,
giggled and likewise showed signs of halting.&nbsp; He thought quickly.&nbsp;
It would never do for Her to come out and see him talking there with
them.&nbsp; Quite naturally, as a matter of course, he swung in along-side
the dark-eyed one and walked with her.&nbsp; There was no awkwardness
on his part, no numb tongue.&nbsp; He was at home here, and he held
his own royally in the badinage, bristling with slang and sharpness,
that was always the preliminary to getting acquainted in these swift-moving
affairs.&nbsp; At the corner where the main stream of people flowed
onward, he started to edge out into the cross street.&nbsp; But the
girl with the black eyes caught his arm, following him and dragging
her companion after her, as she cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Bill!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s yer rush?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
not goin&rsquo; to shake us so sudden as all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He halted with a laugh, and turned, facing them.&nbsp; Across their
shoulders he could see the moving throng passing under the street lamps.&nbsp;
Where he stood it was not so light, and, unseen, he would be able to
see Her as she passed by.&nbsp; She would certainly pass by, for that
way led home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo; he asked of the giggling girl,
nodding at the dark-eyed one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask her,&rdquo; was the convulsed response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; he demanded, turning squarely on
the girl in question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t told me yours, yet,&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never asked it,&rdquo; he smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides,
you guessed the first rattle.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Bill, all right, all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, go &rsquo;long with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked him in
the eyes, her own sharply passionate and inviting.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
is it, honest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she looked.&nbsp; All the centuries of woman since sex began
were eloquent in her eyes.&nbsp; And he measured her in a careless way,
and knew, bold now, that she would begin to retreat, coyly and delicately,
as he pursued, ever ready to reverse the game should he turn fainthearted.&nbsp;
And, too, he was human, and could feel the draw of her, while his ego
could not but appreciate the flattery of her kindness.&nbsp; Oh, he
knew it all, and knew them well, from A to Z.&nbsp; Good, as goodness
might be measured in their particular class, hard-working for meagre
wages and scorning the sale of self for easier ways, nervously desirous
for some small pinch of happiness in the desert of existence, and facing
a future that was a gamble between the ugliness of unending toil and
the black pit of more terrible wretchedness, the way whereto being briefer
though better paid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; he answered, nodding his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sure,
Pete, Bill an&rsquo; no other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No joshin&rsquo;?&rdquo; she queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t Bill at all,&rdquo; the other broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You never
laid eyes on me before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to, to know you&rsquo;re lyin&rsquo;,&rdquo; was the
retort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight, Bill, what is it?&rdquo; the first girl asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he confessed.</p>
<p>She reached out to his arm and shook him playfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
knew you was lyin&rsquo;, but you look good to me just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He captured the hand that invited, and felt on the palm familiar
markings and distortions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When&rsquo;d you chuck the cannery?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d yeh know?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;My, ain&rsquo;t cheh
a mind-reader!&rdquo; the girls chorussed.</p>
<p>And while he exchanged the stupidities of stupid minds with them,
before his inner sight towered the book-shelves of the library, filled
with the wisdom of the ages.&nbsp; He smiled bitterly at the incongruity
of it, and was assailed by doubts.&nbsp; But between inner vision and
outward pleasantry he found time to watch the theatre crowd streaming
by.&nbsp; And then he saw Her, under the lights, between her brother
and the strange young man with glasses, and his heart seemed to stand
still.&nbsp; He had waited long for this moment.&nbsp; He had time to
note the light, fluffy something that hid her queenly head, the tasteful
lines of her wrapped figure, the gracefulness of her carriage and of
the hand that caught up her skirts; and then she was gone and he was
left staring at the two girls of the cannery, at their tawdry attempts
at prettiness of dress, their tragic efforts to be clean and trim, the
cheap cloth, the cheap ribbons, and the cheap rings on the fingers.&nbsp;
He felt a tug at his arm, and heard a voice saying:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Bill!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was you sayin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the dark girl answered, with a toss
of her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was only remarkin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was whisperin&rsquo; it&rsquo;d be a good idea if
you could dig up a gentleman friend&mdash;for her&rdquo; (indicating
her companion), &ldquo;and then, we could go off an&rsquo; have ice-cream
soda somewhere, or coffee, or anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was afflicted by a sudden spiritual nausea.&nbsp; The transition
from Ruth to this had been too abrupt.&nbsp; Ranged side by side with
the bold, defiant eyes of the girl before him, he saw Ruth&rsquo;s clear,
luminous eyes, like a saint&rsquo;s, gazing at him out of unplumbed
depths of purity.&nbsp; And, somehow, he felt within him a stir of power.&nbsp;
He was better than this.&nbsp; Life meant more to him than it meant
to these two girls whose thoughts did not go beyond ice-cream and a
gentleman friend.&nbsp; He remembered that he had led always a secret
life in his thoughts.&nbsp; These thoughts he had tried to share, but
never had he found a woman capable of understanding&mdash;nor a man.&nbsp;
He had tried, at times, but had only puzzled his listeners.&nbsp; And
as his thoughts had been beyond them, so, he argued now, he must be
beyond them.&nbsp; He felt power move in him, and clenched his fists.&nbsp;
If life meant more to him, then it was for him to demand more from life,
but he could not demand it from such companionship as this.&nbsp; Those
bold black eyes had nothing to offer.&nbsp; He knew the thoughts behind
them&mdash;of ice-cream and of something else.&nbsp; But those saint&rsquo;s
eyes alongside&mdash;they offered all he knew and more than he could
guess.&nbsp; They offered books and painting, beauty and repose, and
all the fine elegance of higher existence.&nbsp; Behind those black
eyes he knew every thought process.&nbsp; It was like clockwork.&nbsp;
He could watch every wheel go around.&nbsp; Their bid was low pleasure,
narrow as the grave, that palled, and the grave was at the end of it.&nbsp;
But the bid of the saint&rsquo;s eyes was mystery, and wonder unthinkable,
and eternal life.&nbsp; He had caught glimpses of the soul in them,
and glimpses of his own soul, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing wrong with the programme,&rdquo;
he said aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a date already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes blazed her disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To sit up with a sick friend, I suppose?&rdquo; she sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, a real, honest date with&mdash;&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;with
a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not stringin&rsquo; me?&rdquo; she asked earnestly.</p>
<p>He looked her in the eyes and answered: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s straight,
all right.&nbsp; But why can&rsquo;t we meet some other time?&nbsp;
You ain&rsquo;t told me your name yet.&nbsp; An&rsquo; where d&rsquo;ye
live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lizzie,&rdquo; she replied, softening toward him, her hand
pressing his arm, while her body leaned against his.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lizzie
Connolly.&nbsp; And I live at Fifth an&rsquo; Market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He talked on a few minutes before saying good night.&nbsp; He did
not go home immediately; and under the tree where he kept his vigils
he looked up at a window and murmured: &ldquo;That date was with you,
Ruth.&nbsp; I kept it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>A week of heavy reading had passed since the evening he first met
Ruth Morse, and still he dared not call.&nbsp; Time and again he nerved
himself up to call, but under the doubts that assailed him his determination
died away.&nbsp; He did not know the proper time to call, nor was there
any one to tell him, and he was afraid of committing himself to an irretrievable
blunder.&nbsp; Having shaken himself free from his old companions and
old ways of life, and having no new companions, nothing remained for
him but to read, and the long hours he devoted to it would have ruined
a dozen pairs of ordinary eyes.&nbsp; But his eyes were strong, and
they were backed by a body superbly strong.&nbsp; Furthermore, his mind
was fallow.&nbsp; It had lain fallow all his life so far as the abstract
thought of the books was concerned, and it was ripe for the sowing.&nbsp;
It had never been jaded by study, and it bit hold of the knowledge in
the books with sharp teeth that would not let go.</p>
<p>It seemed to him, by the end of the week, that he had lived centuries,
so far behind were the old life and outlook.&nbsp; But he was baffled
by lack of preparation.&nbsp; He attempted to read books that required
years of preliminary specialization.&nbsp; One day he would read a book
of antiquated philosophy, and the next day one that was ultra-modern,
so that his head would be whirling with the conflict and contradiction
of ideas.&nbsp; It was the same with the economists.&nbsp; On the one
shelf at the library he found Karl Marx, Ricardo, Adam Smith, and Mill,
and the abstruse formulas of the one gave no clew that the ideas of
another were obsolete.&nbsp; He was bewildered, and yet he wanted to
know.&nbsp; He had become interested, in a day, in economics, industry,
and politics.&nbsp; Passing through the City Hall Park, he had noticed
a group of men, in the centre of which were half a dozen, with flushed
faces and raised voices, earnestly carrying on a discussion.&nbsp; He
joined the listeners, and heard a new, alien tongue in the mouths of
the philosophers of the people.&nbsp; One was a tramp, another was a
labor agitator, a third was a law-school student, and the remainder
was composed of wordy workingmen.&nbsp; For the first time he heard
of socialism, anarchism, and single tax, and learned that there were
warring social philosophies.&nbsp; He heard hundreds of technical words
that were new to him, belonging to fields of thought that his meagre
reading had never touched upon.&nbsp; Because of this he could not follow
the arguments closely, and he could only guess at and surmise the ideas
wrapped up in such strange expressions.&nbsp; Then there was a black-eyed
restaurant waiter who was a theosophist, a union baker who was an agnostic,
an old man who baffled all of them with the strange philosophy that
<i>what is is right</i>, and another old man who discoursed interminably
about the cosmos and the father-atom and the mother-atom.</p>
<p>Martin Eden&rsquo;s head was in a state of addlement when he went
away after several hours, and he hurried to the library to look up the
definitions of a dozen unusual words.&nbsp; And when he left the library,
he carried under his arm four volumes: Madam Blavatsky&rsquo;s &ldquo;Secret
Doctrine,&rdquo; &ldquo;Progress and Poverty,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Quintessence
of Socialism,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Warfare of Religion and Science.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Unfortunately, he began on the &ldquo;Secret Doctrine.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Every line bristled with many-syllabled words he did not understand.&nbsp;
He sat up in bed, and the dictionary was in front of him more often
than the book.&nbsp; He looked up so many new words that when they recurred,
he had forgotten their meaning and had to look them up again.&nbsp;
He devised the plan of writing the definitions in a note-book, and filled
page after page with them.&nbsp; And still he could not understand.&nbsp;
He read until three in the morning, and his brain was in a turmoil,
but not one essential thought in the text had he grasped.&nbsp; He looked
up, and it seemed that the room was lifting, heeling, and plunging like
a ship upon the sea.&nbsp; Then he hurled the &ldquo;Secret Doctrine&rdquo;
and many curses across the room, turned off the gas, and composed himself
to sleep.&nbsp; Nor did he have much better luck with the other three
books.&nbsp; It was not that his brain was weak or incapable; it could
think these thoughts were it not for lack of training in thinking and
lack of the thought-tools with which to think.&nbsp; He guessed this,
and for a while entertained the idea of reading nothing but the dictionary
until he had mastered every word in it.</p>
<p>Poetry, however, was his solace, and he read much of it, finding
his greatest joy in the simpler poets, who were more understandable.&nbsp;
He loved beauty, and there he found beauty.&nbsp; Poetry, like music,
stirred him profoundly, and, though he did not know it, he was preparing
his mind for the heavier work that was to come.&nbsp; The pages of his
mind were blank, and, without effort, much he read and liked, stanza
by stanza, was impressed upon those pages, so that he was soon able
to extract great joy from chanting aloud or under his breath the music
and the beauty of the printed words he had read.&nbsp; Then he stumbled
upon Gayley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Classic Myths&rdquo; and Bulfinch&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Age of Fable,&rdquo; side by side on a library shelf.&nbsp; It
was illumination, a great light in the darkness of his ignorance, and
he read poetry more avidly than ever.</p>
<p>The man at the desk in the library had seen Martin there so often
that he had become quite cordial, always greeting him with a smile and
a nod when he entered.&nbsp; It was because of this that Martin did
a daring thing.&nbsp; Drawing out some books at the desk, and while
the man was stamping the cards, Martin blurted out:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man smiled and paid attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you meet a young lady an&rsquo; she asks you to call,
how soon can you call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin felt his shirt press and cling to his shoulders, what of the
sweat of the effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I&rsquo;d say any time,&rdquo; the man answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but this is different,&rdquo; Martin objected.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&mdash;I&mdash;well, you see, it&rsquo;s this way: maybe she
won&rsquo;t be there.&nbsp; She goes to the university.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then call again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I said ain&rsquo;t what I meant,&rdquo; Martin confessed
falteringly, while he made up his mind to throw himself wholly upon
the other&rsquo;s mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a rough sort of
a fellow, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t never seen anything of society.&nbsp;
This girl is all that I ain&rsquo;t, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t anything
that she is.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m playin&rsquo; the
fool, do you?&rdquo; he demanded abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; not at all, I assure you,&rdquo; the other protested.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your request is not exactly in the scope of the reference department,
but I shall be only too pleased to assist you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin looked at him admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could tear it off that way, I&rsquo;d be all right,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean if I could talk easy that way, an&rsquo; polite, an&rsquo;
all the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the other, with comprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the best time to call?&nbsp; The afternoon?&mdash;not
too close to meal-time?&nbsp; Or the evening?&nbsp; Or Sunday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; the librarian said with a brightening
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;You call her up on the telephone and find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he said, picking up his books and
starting away.</p>
<p>He turned back and asked:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re speakin&rsquo; to a young lady&mdash;say,
for instance, Miss Lizzie Smith&mdash;do you say &lsquo;Miss Lizzie&rsquo;?
or &lsquo;Miss Smith&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say &lsquo;Miss Smith,&rsquo;&rdquo; the librarian stated
authoritatively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say &lsquo;Miss Smith&rsquo; always&mdash;until
you come to know her better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was that Martin Eden solved the problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down any time; I&rsquo;ll be at home all afternoon,&rdquo;
was Ruth&rsquo;s reply over the telephone to his stammered request as
to when he could return the borrowed books.</p>
<p>She met him at the door herself, and her woman&rsquo;s eyes took
in immediately the creased trousers and the certain slight but indefinable
change in him for the better.&nbsp; Also, she was struck by his face.&nbsp;
It was almost violent, this health of his, and it seemed to rush out
of him and at her in waves of force.&nbsp; She felt the urge again of
the desire to lean toward him for warmth, and marvelled again at the
effect his presence produced upon her.&nbsp; And he, in turn, knew again
the swimming sensation of bliss when he felt the contact of her hand
in greeting.&nbsp; The difference between them lay in that she was cool
and self-possessed while his face flushed to the roots of the hair.&nbsp;
He stumbled with his old awkwardness after her, and his shoulders swung
and lurched perilously.</p>
<p>Once they were seated in the living-room, he began to get on easily&mdash;more
easily by far than he had expected.&nbsp; She made it easy for him;
and the gracious spirit with which she did it made him love her more
madly than ever.&nbsp; They talked first of the borrowed books, of the
Swinburne he was devoted to, and of the Browning he did not understand;
and she led the conversation on from subject to subject, while she pondered
the problem of how she could be of help to him.&nbsp; She had thought
of this often since their first meeting.&nbsp; She wanted to help him.&nbsp;
He made a call upon her pity and tenderness that no one had ever made
before, and the pity was not so much derogatory of him as maternal in
her.&nbsp; Her pity could not be of the common sort, when the man who
drew it was so much man as to shock her with maidenly fears and set
her mind and pulse thrilling with strange thoughts and feelings.&nbsp;
The old fascination of his neck was there, and there was sweetness in
the thought of laying her hands upon it.&nbsp; It seemed still a wanton
impulse, but she had grown more used to it.&nbsp; She did not dream
that in such guise new-born love would epitomize itself.&nbsp; Nor did
she dream that the feeling he excited in her was love.&nbsp; She thought
she was merely interested in him as an unusual type possessing various
potential excellencies, and she even felt philanthropic about it.</p>
<p>She did not know she desired him; but with him it was different.&nbsp;
He knew that he loved her, and he desired her as he had never before
desired anything in his life.&nbsp; He had loved poetry for beauty&rsquo;s
sake; but since he met her the gates to the vast field of love-poetry
had been opened wide.&nbsp; She had given him understanding even more
than Bulfinch and Gayley.&nbsp; There was a line that a week before
he would not have favored with a second thought&mdash;&ldquo;God&rsquo;s
own mad lover dying on a kiss&rdquo;; but now it was ever insistent
in his mind.&nbsp; He marvelled at the wonder of it and the truth; and
as he gazed upon her he knew that he could die gladly upon a kiss.&nbsp;
He felt himself God&rsquo;s own mad lover, and no accolade of knighthood
could have given him greater pride.&nbsp; And at last he knew the meaning
of life and why he had been born.</p>
<p>As he gazed at her and listened, his thoughts grew daring.&nbsp;
He reviewed all the wild delight of the pressure of her hand in his
at the door, and longed for it again.&nbsp; His gaze wandered often
toward her lips, and he yearned for them hungrily.&nbsp; But there was
nothing gross or earthly about this yearning.&nbsp; It gave him exquisite
delight to watch every movement and play of those lips as they enunciated
the words she spoke; yet they were not ordinary lips such as all men
and women had.&nbsp; Their substance was not mere human clay.&nbsp;
They were lips of pure spirit, and his desire for them seemed absolutely
different from the desire that had led him to other women&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp;
He could kiss her lips, rest his own physical lips upon them, but it
would be with the lofty and awful fervor with which one would kiss the
robe of God.&nbsp; He was not conscious of this transvaluation of values
that had taken place in him, and was unaware that the light that shone
in his eyes when he looked at her was quite the same light that shines
in all men&rsquo;s eyes when the desire of love is upon them.&nbsp;
He did not dream how ardent and masculine his gaze was, nor that the
warm flame of it was affecting the alchemy of her spirit.&nbsp; Her
penetrative virginity exalted and disguised his own emotions, elevating
his thoughts to a star-cool chastity, and he would have been startled
to learn that there was that shining out of his eyes, like warm waves,
that flowed through her and kindled a kindred warmth.&nbsp; She was
subtly perturbed by it, and more than once, though she knew not why,
it disrupted her train of thought with its delicious intrusion and compelled
her to grope for the remainder of ideas partly uttered.&nbsp; Speech
was always easy with her, and these interruptions would have puzzled
her had she not decided that it was because he was a remarkable type.&nbsp;
She was very sensitive to impressions, and it was not strange, after
all, that this aura of a traveller from another world should so affect
her.</p>
<p>The problem in the background of her consciousness was how to help
him, and she turned the conversation in that direction; but it was Martin
who came to the point first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I can get some advice from you,&rdquo; he began,
and received an acquiescence of willingness that made his heart bound.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You remember the other time I was here I said I couldn&rsquo;t
talk about books an&rsquo; things because I didn&rsquo;t know how?&nbsp;
Well, I&rsquo;ve ben doin&rsquo; a lot of thinkin&rsquo; ever since.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve ben to the library a whole lot, but most of the books I&rsquo;ve
tackled have ben over my head.&nbsp; Mebbe I&rsquo;d better begin at
the beginnin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t never had no advantages.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve worked pretty hard ever since I was a kid, an&rsquo; since
I&rsquo;ve ben to the library, lookin&rsquo; with new eyes at books&mdash;an&rsquo;
lookin&rsquo; at new books, too&mdash;I&rsquo;ve just about concluded
that I ain&rsquo;t ben reading the right kind.&nbsp; You know the books
you find in cattle-camps an&rsquo; fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;s&rsquo;ls ain&rsquo;t
the same you&rsquo;ve got in this house, for instance.&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s
the sort of readin&rsquo; matter I&rsquo;ve ben accustomed to.&nbsp;
And yet&mdash;an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t just makin&rsquo; a brag of it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
ben different from the people I&rsquo;ve herded with.&nbsp; Not that
I&rsquo;m any better than the sailors an&rsquo; cow-punchers I travelled
with,&mdash;I was cow-punchin&rsquo; for a short time, you know,&mdash;but
I always liked books, read everything I could lay hands on, an&rsquo;&mdash;well,
I guess I think differently from most of &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, to come to what I&rsquo;m drivin&rsquo; at.&nbsp; I was
never inside a house like this.&nbsp; When I come a week ago, an&rsquo;
saw all this, an&rsquo; you, an&rsquo; your mother, an&rsquo; brothers,
an&rsquo; everything&mdash;well, I liked it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d heard about
such things an&rsquo; read about such things in some of the books, an&rsquo;
when I looked around at your house, why, the books come true.&nbsp;
But the thing I&rsquo;m after is I liked it.&nbsp; I wanted it.&nbsp;
I want it now.&nbsp; I want to breathe air like you get in this house&mdash;air
that is filled with books, and pictures, and beautiful things, where
people talk in low voices an&rsquo; are clean, an&rsquo; their thoughts
are clean.&nbsp; The air I always breathed was mixed up with grub an&rsquo;
house-rent an&rsquo; scrappin&rsquo; an booze an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
all they talked about, too.&nbsp; Why, when you was crossin&rsquo; the
room to kiss your mother, I thought it was the most beautiful thing
I ever seen.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen a whole lot of life, an&rsquo; somehow
I&rsquo;ve seen a whole lot more of it than most of them that was with
me.&nbsp; I like to see, an&rsquo; I want to see more, an&rsquo; I want
to see it different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I ain&rsquo;t got to the point yet.&nbsp; Here it is.&nbsp;
I want to make my way to the kind of life you have in this house.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s more in life than booze, an&rsquo; hard work, an&rsquo;
knockin&rsquo; about.&nbsp; Now, how am I goin&rsquo; to get it?&nbsp;
Where do I take hold an&rsquo; begin?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo;
to work my passage, you know, an&rsquo; I can make most men sick when
it comes to hard work.&nbsp; Once I get started, I&rsquo;ll work night
an&rsquo; day.&nbsp; Mebbe you think it&rsquo;s funny, me askin&rsquo;
you about all this.&nbsp; I know you&rsquo;re the last person in the
world I ought to ask, but I don&rsquo;t know anybody else I could ask&mdash;unless
it&rsquo;s Arthur.&nbsp; Mebbe I ought to ask him.&nbsp; If I was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice died away.&nbsp; His firmly planned intention had come
to a halt on the verge of the horrible probability that he should have
asked Arthur and that he had made a fool of himself.&nbsp; Ruth did
not speak immediately.&nbsp; She was too absorbed in striving to reconcile
the stumbling, uncouth speech and its simplicity of thought with what
she saw in his face.&nbsp; She had never looked in eyes that expressed
greater power.&nbsp; Here was a man who could do anything, was the message
she read there, and it accorded ill with the weakness of his spoken
thought.&nbsp; And for that matter so complex and quick was her own
mind that she did not have a just appreciation of simplicity.&nbsp;
And yet she had caught an impression of power in the very groping of
this mind.&nbsp; It had seemed to her like a giant writhing and straining
at the bonds that held him down.&nbsp; Her face was all sympathy when
she did speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you need, you realize yourself, and it is education.&nbsp;
You should go back and finish grammar school, and then go through to
high school and university.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that takes money,&rdquo; he interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had not thought of that.&nbsp;
But then you have relatives, somebody who could assist you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father and mother are dead.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve two sisters,
one married, an&rsquo; the other&rsquo;ll get married soon, I suppose.&nbsp;
Then I&rsquo;ve a string of brothers,&mdash;I&rsquo;m the youngest,&mdash;but
they never helped nobody.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve just knocked around over
the world, lookin&rsquo; out for number one.&nbsp; The oldest died in
India.&nbsp; Two are in South Africa now, an&rsquo; another&rsquo;s
on a whaling voyage, an&rsquo; one&rsquo;s travellin&rsquo; with a circus&mdash;he
does trapeze work.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I guess I&rsquo;m just like them.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve taken care of myself since I was eleven&mdash;that&rsquo;s
when my mother died.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to study by myself, I guess,
an&rsquo; what I want to know is where to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say the first thing of all would be to get a grammar.&nbsp;
Your grammar is&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She had intended saying &ldquo;awful,&rdquo;
but she amended it to &ldquo;is not particularly good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flushed and sweated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I must talk a lot of slang an&rsquo; words you don&rsquo;t
understand.&nbsp; But then they&rsquo;re the only words I know&mdash;how
to speak.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got other words in my mind, picked &rsquo;em
up from books, but I can&rsquo;t pronounce &rsquo;em, so I don&rsquo;t
use &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t what you say, so much as how you say it.&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t mind my being frank, do you?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want
to hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he cried, while he secretly blessed her for
her kindness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fire away.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to know,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d sooner know from you than anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you say, &lsquo;You was&rsquo;; it should be,
&lsquo;You were.&rsquo;&nbsp; You say &lsquo;I seen&rsquo; for &lsquo;I
saw.&rsquo;&nbsp; You use the double negative&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the double negative?&rdquo; he demanded; then
added humbly, &ldquo;You see, I don&rsquo;t even understand your explanations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t explain that,&rdquo; she smiled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A double negative is&mdash;let me see&mdash;well, you say, &lsquo;never
helped nobody.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Never&rsquo; is a negative.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nobody&rsquo; is another negative.&nbsp; It is a rule that two
negatives make a positive.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never helped nobody&rsquo; means
that, not helping nobody, they must have helped somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty clear,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
never thought of it before.&nbsp; But it don&rsquo;t mean they <i>must</i>
have helped somebody, does it?&nbsp; Seems to me that &lsquo;never helped
nobody&rsquo; just naturally fails to say whether or not they helped
somebody.&nbsp; I never thought of it before, and I&rsquo;ll never say
it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was pleased and surprised with the quickness and surety of his
mind.&nbsp; As soon as he had got the clew he not only understood but
corrected her error.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it all in the grammar,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else I noticed in your speech.&nbsp;
You say &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo; when you shouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t&rsquo;
is a contraction and stands for two words.&nbsp; Do you know them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought a moment, then answered, &ldquo;&lsquo;Do not.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head, and said, &ldquo;And you use &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo;
when you mean &lsquo;does not.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was puzzled over this, and did not get it so quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me an illustration,&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She puckered her brows and pursed
up her mouth as she thought, while he looked on and decided that her
expression was most adorable.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;It don&rsquo;t do
to be hasty.&rsquo;&nbsp; Change &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo; to &lsquo;do
not,&rsquo; and it reads, &lsquo;It do not do to be hasty,&rsquo; which
is perfectly absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned it over in his mind and considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it jar on your ear?&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say that it does,&rdquo; he replied judicially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say, &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say that it do&rsquo;?&rdquo;
she queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds wrong,&rdquo; he said slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
for the other I can&rsquo;t make up my mind.&nbsp; I guess my ear ain&rsquo;t
had the trainin&rsquo; yours has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no such word as &lsquo;ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she said, prettily emphatic.</p>
<p>Martin flushed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you say &lsquo;ben&rsquo; for &lsquo;been,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she continued; &ldquo;&lsquo;come&rsquo; for &lsquo;came&rsquo;; and
the way you chop your endings is something dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;&nbsp; He leaned forward, feeling that
he ought to get down on his knees before so marvellous a mind.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How do I chop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t complete the endings.&nbsp; &lsquo;A-n-d&rsquo;
spells &lsquo;and.&rsquo;&nbsp; You pronounce it &lsquo;an&rsquo;.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I-n-g&rsquo; spells &lsquo;ing.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sometimes you pronounce
it &lsquo;ing&rsquo; and sometimes you leave off the &lsquo;g.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And then you slur by dropping initial letters and diphthongs.&nbsp;
&lsquo;T-h-e-m&rsquo; spells &lsquo;them.&rsquo;&nbsp; You pronounce
it&mdash;oh, well, it is not necessary to go over all of them.&nbsp;
What you need is the grammar.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll get one and show you
how to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she arose, there shot through his mind something that he had read
in the etiquette books, and he stood up awkwardly, worrying as to whether
he was doing the right thing, and fearing that she might take it as
a sign that he was about to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Mr. Eden,&rdquo; she called back, as she was leaving
the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is <i>booze</i>?&nbsp; You used it several
times, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, booze,&rdquo; he laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s slang.&nbsp;
It means whiskey an&rsquo; beer&mdash;anything that will make you drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And another thing,&rdquo; she laughed back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
use &lsquo;you&rsquo; when you are impersonal.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;
is very personal, and your use of it just now was not precisely what
you meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t just see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you said just now, to me, &lsquo;whiskey and beer&mdash;anything
that will make you drunk&rsquo;&mdash;make me drunk, don&rsquo;t you
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it would, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; she smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it would
be nicer not to bring me into it.&nbsp; Substitute &lsquo;one&rsquo;
for &lsquo;you&rsquo; and see how much better it sounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she returned with the grammar, she drew a chair near his&mdash;he
wondered if he should have helped her with the chair&mdash;and sat down
beside him.&nbsp; She turned the pages of the grammar, and their heads
were inclined toward each other.&nbsp; He could hardly follow her outlining
of the work he must do, so amazed was he by her delightful propinquity.&nbsp;
But when she began to lay down the importance of conjugation, he forgot
all about her.&nbsp; He had never heard of conjugation, and was fascinated
by the glimpse he was catching into the tie-ribs of language.&nbsp;
He leaned closer to the page, and her hair touched his cheek.&nbsp;
He had fainted but once in his life, and he thought he was going to
faint again.&nbsp; He could scarcely breathe, and his heart was pounding
the blood up into his throat and suffocating him.&nbsp; Never had she
seemed so accessible as now.&nbsp; For the moment the great gulf that
separated them was bridged.&nbsp; But there was no diminution in the
loftiness of his feeling for her.&nbsp; She had not descended to him.&nbsp;
It was he who had been caught up into the clouds and carried to her.&nbsp;
His reverence for her, in that moment, was of the same order as religious
awe and fervor.&nbsp; It seemed to him that he had intruded upon the
holy of holies, and slowly and carefully he moved his head aside from
the contact which thrilled him like an electric shock and of which she
had not been aware.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>Several weeks went by, during which Martin Eden studied his grammar,
reviewed the books on etiquette, and read voraciously the books that
caught his fancy.&nbsp; Of his own class he saw nothing.&nbsp; The girls
of the Lotus Club wondered what had become of him and worried Jim with
questions, and some of the fellows who put on the glove at Riley&rsquo;s
were glad that Martin came no more.&nbsp; He made another discovery
of treasure-trove in the library.&nbsp; As the grammar had shown him
the tie-ribs of language, so that book showed him the tie-ribs of poetry,
and he began to learn metre and construction and form, beneath the beauty
he loved finding the why and wherefore of that beauty.&nbsp; Another
modern book he found treated poetry as a representative art, treated
it exhaustively, with copious illustrations from the best in literature.&nbsp;
Never had he read fiction with so keen zest as he studied these books.&nbsp;
And his fresh mind, untaxed for twenty years and impelled by maturity
of desire, gripped hold of what he read with a virility unusual to the
student mind.</p>
<p>When he looked back now from his vantage-ground, the old world he
had known, the world of land and sea and ships, of sailor-men and harpy-women,
seemed a very small world; and yet it blended in with this new world
and expanded.&nbsp; His mind made for unity, and he was surprised when
at first he began to see points of contact between the two worlds.&nbsp;
And he was ennobled, as well, by the loftiness of thought and beauty
he found in the books.&nbsp; This led him to believe more firmly than
ever that up above him, in society like Ruth and her family, all men
and women thought these thoughts and lived them.&nbsp; Down below where
he lived was the ignoble, and he wanted to purge himself of the ignoble
that had soiled all his days, and to rise to that sublimated realm where
dwelt the upper classes.&nbsp; All his childhood and youth had been
troubled by a vague unrest; he had never known what he wanted, but he
had wanted something that he had hunted vainly for until he met Ruth.&nbsp;
And now his unrest had become sharp and painful, and he knew at last,
clearly and definitely, that it was beauty, and intellect, and love
that he must have.</p>
<p>During those several weeks he saw Ruth half a dozen times, and each
time was an added inspiration.&nbsp; She helped him with his English,
corrected his pronunciation, and started him on arithmetic.&nbsp; But
their intercourse was not all devoted to elementary study.&nbsp; He
had seen too much of life, and his mind was too matured, to be wholly
content with fractions, cube root, parsing, and analysis; and there
were times when their conversation turned on other themes&mdash;the
last poetry he had read, the latest poet she had studied.&nbsp; And
when she read aloud to him her favorite passages, he ascended to the
topmost heaven of delight.&nbsp; Never, in all the women he had heard
speak, had he heard a voice like hers.&nbsp; The least sound of it was
a stimulus to his love, and he thrilled and throbbed with every word
she uttered.&nbsp; It was the quality of it, the repose, and the musical
modulation&mdash;the soft, rich, indefinable product of culture and
a gentle soul.&nbsp; As he listened to her, there rang in the ears of
his memory the harsh cries of barbarian women and of hags, and, in lesser
degrees of harshness, the strident voices of working women and of the
girls of his own class.&nbsp; Then the chemistry of vision would begin
to work, and they would troop in review across his mind, each, by contrast,
multiplying Ruth&rsquo;s glories.&nbsp; Then, too, his bliss was heightened
by the knowledge that her mind was comprehending what she read and was
quivering with appreciation of the beauty of the written thought.&nbsp;
She read to him much from &ldquo;The Princess,&rdquo; and often he saw
her eyes swimming with tears, so finely was her aesthetic nature strung.&nbsp;
At such moments her own emotions elevated him till he was as a god,
and, as he gazed at her and listened, he seemed gazing on the face of
life and reading its deepest secrets.&nbsp; And then, becoming aware
of the heights of exquisite sensibility he attained, he decided that
this was love and that love was the greatest thing in the world.&nbsp;
And in review would pass along the corridors of memory all previous
thrills and burnings he had known,&mdash;the drunkenness of wine, the
caresses of women, the rough play and give and take of physical contests,&mdash;and
they seemed trivial and mean compared with this sublime ardor he now
enjoyed.</p>
<p>The situation was obscured to Ruth.&nbsp; She had never had any experiences
of the heart.&nbsp; Her only experiences in such matters were of the
books, where the facts of ordinary day were translated by fancy into
a fairy realm of unreality; and she little knew that this rough sailor
was creeping into her heart and storing there pent forces that would
some day burst forth and surge through her in waves of fire.&nbsp; She
did not know the actual fire of love.&nbsp; Her knowledge of love was
purely theoretical, and she conceived of it as lambent flame, gentle
as the fall of dew or the ripple of quiet water, and cool as the velvet-dark
of summer nights.&nbsp; Her idea of love was more that of placid affection,
serving the loved one softly in an atmosphere, flower-scented and dim-lighted,
of ethereal calm.&nbsp; She did not dream of the volcanic convulsions
of love, its scorching heat and sterile wastes of parched ashes.&nbsp;
She knew neither her own potencies, nor the potencies of the world;
and the deeps of life were to her seas of illusion.&nbsp; The conjugal
affection of her father and mother constituted her ideal of love-affinity,
and she looked forward some day to emerging, without shock or friction,
into that same quiet sweetness of existence with a loved one.</p>
<p>So it was that she looked upon Martin Eden as a novelty, a strange
individual, and she identified with novelty and strangeness the effects
he produced upon her.&nbsp; It was only natural.&nbsp; In similar ways
she had experienced unusual feelings when she looked at wild animals
in the menagerie, or when she witnessed a storm of wind, or shuddered
at the bright-ribbed lightning.&nbsp; There was something cosmic in
such things, and there was something cosmic in him.&nbsp; He came to
her breathing of large airs and great spaces.&nbsp; The blaze of tropic
suns was in his face, and in his swelling, resilient muscles was the
primordial vigor of life.&nbsp; He was marred and scarred by that mysterious
world of rough men and rougher deeds, the outposts of which began beyond
her horizon.&nbsp; He was untamed, wild, and in secret ways her vanity
was touched by the fact that he came so mildly to her hand.&nbsp; Likewise
she was stirred by the common impulse to tame the wild thing.&nbsp;
It was an unconscious impulse, and farthest from her thoughts that her
desire was to re-thumb the clay of him into a likeness of her father&rsquo;s
image, which image she believed to be the finest in the world.&nbsp;
Nor was there any way, out of her inexperience, for her to know that
the cosmic feel she caught of him was that most cosmic of things, love,
which with equal power drew men and women together across the world,
compelled stags to kill each other in the rutting season, and drove
even the elements irresistibly to unite.</p>
<p>His swift development was a source of surprise and interest.&nbsp;
She detected unguessed finenesses in him that seemed to bud, day by
day, like flowers in congenial soil.&nbsp; She read Browning aloud to
him, and was often puzzled by the strange interpretations he gave to
mooted passages.&nbsp; It was beyond her to realize that, out of his
experience of men and women and life, his interpretations were far more
frequently correct than hers.&nbsp; His conceptions seemed naive to
her, though she was often fired by his daring flights of comprehension,
whose orbit-path was so wide among the stars that she could not follow
and could only sit and thrill to the impact of unguessed power.&nbsp;
Then she played to him&mdash;no longer at him&mdash;and probed him with
music that sank to depths beyond her plumb-line.&nbsp; His nature opened
to music as a flower to the sun, and the transition was quick from his
working-class rag-time and jingles to her classical display pieces that
she knew nearly by heart.&nbsp; Yet he betrayed a democratic fondness
for Wagner, and the &ldquo;Tannh&auml;user&rdquo; overture, when she
had given him the clew to it, claimed him as nothing else she played.&nbsp;
In an immediate way it personified his life.&nbsp; All his past was
the <i>Venusburg</i> motif, while her he identified somehow with the
<i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Chorus</i> motif; and from the exalted state this
elevated him to, he swept onward and upward into that vast shadow-realm
of spirit-groping, where good and evil war eternally.</p>
<p>Sometimes he questioned, and induced in her mind temporary doubts
as to the correctness of her own definitions and conceptions of music.&nbsp;
But her singing he did not question.&nbsp; It was too wholly her, and
he sat always amazed at the divine melody of her pure soprano voice.&nbsp;
And he could not help but contrast it with the weak pipings and shrill
quaverings of factory girls, ill-nourished and untrained, and with the
raucous shriekings from gin-cracked throats of the women of the seaport
towns.&nbsp; She enjoyed singing and playing to him.&nbsp; In truth,
it was the first time she had ever had a human soul to play with, and
the plastic clay of him was a delight to mould; for she thought she
was moulding it, and her intentions were good.&nbsp; Besides, it was
pleasant to be with him.&nbsp; He did not repel her.&nbsp; That first
repulsion had been really a fear of her undiscovered self, and the fear
had gone to sleep.&nbsp; Though she did not know it, she had a feeling
in him of proprietary right.&nbsp; Also, he had a tonic effect upon
her.&nbsp; She was studying hard at the university, and it seemed to
strengthen her to emerge from the dusty books and have the fresh sea-breeze
of his personality blow upon her.&nbsp; Strength!&nbsp; Strength was
what she needed, and he gave it to her in generous measure.&nbsp; To
come into the same room with him, or to meet him at the door, was to
take heart of life.&nbsp; And when he had gone, she would return to
her books with a keener zest and fresh store of energy.</p>
<p>She knew her Browning, but it had never sunk into her that it was
an awkward thing to play with souls.&nbsp; As her interest in Martin
increased, the remodelling of his life became a passion with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Mr. Butler,&rdquo; she said one afternoon, when grammar
and arithmetic and poetry had been put aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had comparatively no advantages at first.&nbsp; His father
had been a bank cashier, but he lingered for years, dying of consumption
in Arizona, so that when he was dead, Mr. Butler, Charles Butler he
was called, found himself alone in the world.&nbsp; His father had come
from Australia, you know, and so he had no relatives in California.&nbsp;
He went to work in a printing-office,&mdash;I have heard him tell of
it many times,&mdash;and he got three dollars a week, at first.&nbsp;
His income to-day is at least thirty thousand a year.&nbsp; How did
he do it?&nbsp; He was honest, and faithful, and industrious, and economical.&nbsp;
He denied himself the enjoyments that most boys indulge in.&nbsp; He
made it a point to save so much every week, no matter what he had to
do without in order to save it.&nbsp; Of course, he was soon earning
more than three dollars a week, and as his wages increased he saved
more and more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He worked in the daytime, and at night he went to night school.&nbsp;
He had his eyes fixed always on the future.&nbsp; Later on he went to
night high school.&nbsp; When he was only seventeen, he was earning
excellent wages at setting type, but he was ambitious.&nbsp; He wanted
a career, not a livelihood, and he was content to make immediate sacrifices
for his ultimate again.&nbsp; He decided upon the law, and he entered
father&rsquo;s office as an office boy&mdash;think of that!&mdash;and
got only four dollars a week.&nbsp; But he had learned how to be economical,
and out of that four dollars he went on saving money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused for breath, and to note how Martin was receiving it.&nbsp;
His face was lighted up with interest in the youthful struggles of Mr.
Butler; but there was a frown upon his face as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say they was pretty hard lines for a young fellow,&rdquo;
he remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Four dollars a week!&nbsp; How could he live
on it?&nbsp; You can bet he didn&rsquo;t have any frills.&nbsp; Why,
I pay five dollars a week for board now, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;
excitin&rsquo; about it, you can lay to that.&nbsp; He must have lived
like a dog.&nbsp; The food he ate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He cooked for himself,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;on a
little kerosene stove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The food he ate must have been worse than what a sailor gets
on the worst-feedin&rsquo; deep-water ships, than which there ain&rsquo;t
much that can be possibly worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of him now!&rdquo; she cried enthusiastically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Think of what his income affords him.&nbsp; His early denials
are paid for a thousand-fold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin looked at her sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ll bet you,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and it is that Mr. Butler is nothin&rsquo; gay-hearted now in
his fat days.&nbsp; He fed himself like that for years an&rsquo; years,
on a boy&rsquo;s stomach, an&rsquo; I bet his stomach&rsquo;s none too
good now for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes dropped before his searching gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s got dyspepsia right now!&rdquo;
Martin challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has,&rdquo; she confessed; &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I bet,&rdquo; Martin dashed on, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;s
solemn an&rsquo; serious as an old owl, an&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t care
a rap for a good time, for all his thirty thousand a year.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s not particularly joyful at seein&rsquo; others
have a good time.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head in agreement, and hastened to explain:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he is not that type of man.&nbsp; By nature he is sober
and serious.&nbsp; He always was that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can bet he was,&rdquo; Martin proclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three
dollars a week, an&rsquo; four dollars a week, an&rsquo; a young boy
cookin&rsquo; for himself on an oil-burner an&rsquo; layin&rsquo; up
money, workin&rsquo; all day an&rsquo; studyin&rsquo; all night, just
workin&rsquo; an&rsquo; never playin&rsquo;, never havin&rsquo; a good
time, an&rsquo; never learnin&rsquo; how to have a good time&mdash;of
course his thirty thousand came along too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His sympathetic imagination was flashing upon his inner sight all
the thousands of details of the boy&rsquo;s existence and of his narrow
spiritual development into a thirty-thousand-dollar-a-year man.&nbsp;
With the swiftness and wide-reaching of multitudinous thought Charles
Butler&rsquo;s whole life was telescoped upon his vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I feel sorry for Mr.
Butler.&nbsp; He was too young to know better, but he robbed himself
of life for the sake of thirty thousand a year that&rsquo;s clean wasted
upon him.&nbsp; Why, thirty thousand, lump sum, wouldn&rsquo;t buy for
him right now what ten cents he was layin&rsquo; up would have bought
him, when he was a kid, in the way of candy an&rsquo; peanuts or a seat
in nigger heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was just such uniqueness of points of view that startled Ruth.&nbsp;
Not only were they new to her, and contrary to her own beliefs, but
she always felt in them germs of truth that threatened to unseat or
modify her own convictions.&nbsp; Had she been fourteen instead of twenty-four,
she might have been changed by them; but she was twenty-four, conservative
by nature and upbringing, and already crystallized into the cranny of
life where she had been born and formed.&nbsp; It was true, his bizarre
judgments troubled her in the moments they were uttered, but she ascribed
them to his novelty of type and strangeness of living, and they were
soon forgotten.&nbsp; Nevertheless, while she disapproved of them, the
strength of their utterance, and the flashing of eyes and earnestness
of face that accompanied them, always thrilled her and drew her toward
him.&nbsp; She would never have guessed that this man who had come from
beyond her horizon, was, in such moments, flashing on beyond her horizon
with wider and deeper concepts.&nbsp; Her own limits were the limits
of her horizon; but limited minds can recognize limitations only in
others.&nbsp; And so she felt that her outlook was very wide indeed,
and that where his conflicted with hers marked his limitations; and
she dreamed of helping him to see as she saw, of widening his horizon
until it was identified with hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have not finished my story,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
worked, so father says, as no other office boy he ever had.&nbsp; Mr.
Butler was always eager to work.&nbsp; He never was late, and he was
usually at the office a few minutes before his regular time.&nbsp; And
yet he saved his time.&nbsp; Every spare moment was devoted to study.&nbsp;
He studied book-keeping and type-writing, and he paid for lessons in
shorthand by dictating at night to a court reporter who needed practice.&nbsp;
He quickly became a clerk, and he made himself invaluable.&nbsp; Father
appreciated him and saw that he was bound to rise.&nbsp; It was on father&rsquo;s
suggestion that he went to law college.&nbsp; He became a lawyer, and
hardly was he back in the office when father took him in as junior partner.&nbsp;
He is a great man.&nbsp; He refused the United States Senate several
times, and father says he could become a justice of the Supreme Court
any time a vacancy occurs, if he wants to.&nbsp; Such a life is an inspiration
to all of us.&nbsp; It shows us that a man with will may rise superior
to his environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a great man,&rdquo; Martin said sincerely.</p>
<p>But it seemed to him there was something in the recital that jarred
upon his sense of beauty and life.&nbsp; He could not find an adequate
motive in Mr. Butler&rsquo;s life of pinching and privation.&nbsp; Had
he done it for love of a woman, or for attainment of beauty, Martin
would have understood.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s own mad lover should do anything
for the kiss, but not for thirty thousand dollars a year.&nbsp; He was
dissatisfied with Mr. Butler&rsquo;s career.&nbsp; There was something
paltry about it, after all.&nbsp; Thirty thousand a year was all right,
but dyspepsia and inability to be humanly happy robbed such princely
income of all its value.</p>
<p>Much of this he strove to express to Ruth, and shocked her and made
it clear that more remodelling was necessary.&nbsp; Hers was that common
insularity of mind that makes human creatures believe that their color,
creed, and politics are best and right and that other human creatures
scattered over the world are less fortunately placed than they.&nbsp;
It was the same insularity of mind that made the ancient Jew thank God
he was not born a woman, and sent the modern missionary god-substituting
to the ends of the earth; and it made Ruth desire to shape this man
from other crannies of life into the likeness of the men who lived in
her particular cranny of life.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>Back from sea Martin Eden came, homing for California with a lover&rsquo;s
desire.&nbsp; His store of money exhausted, he had shipped before the
mast on the treasure-hunting schooner; and the Solomon Islands, after
eight months of failure to find treasure, had witnessed the breaking
up of the expedition.&nbsp; The men had been paid off in Australia,
and Martin had immediately shipped on a deep-water vessel for San Francisco.&nbsp;
Not alone had those eight months earned him enough money to stay on
land for many weeks, but they had enabled him to do a great deal of
studying and reading.</p>
<p>His was the student&rsquo;s mind, and behind his ability to learn
was the indomitability of his nature and his love for Ruth.&nbsp; The
grammar he had taken along he went through again and again until his
unjaded brain had mastered it.&nbsp; He noticed the bad grammar used
by his shipmates, and made a point of mentally correcting and reconstructing
their crudities of speech.&nbsp; To his great joy he discovered that
his ear was becoming sensitive and that he was developing grammatical
nerves.&nbsp; A double negative jarred him like a discord, and often,
from lack of practice, it was from his own lips that the jar came.&nbsp;
His tongue refused to learn new tricks in a day.</p>
<p>After he had been through the grammar repeatedly, he took up the
dictionary and added twenty words a day to his vocabulary.&nbsp; He
found that this was no light task, and at wheel or lookout he steadily
went over and over his lengthening list of pronunciations and definitions,
while he invariably memorized himself to sleep.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never did
anything,&rdquo; &ldquo;if I were,&rdquo; and &ldquo;those things,&rdquo;
were phrases, with many variations, that he repeated under his breath
in order to accustom his tongue to the language spoken by Ruth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And&rdquo; and &ldquo;ing,&rdquo; with the &ldquo;d&rdquo; and
&ldquo;g&rdquo; pronounced emphatically, he went over thousands of times;
and to his surprise he noticed that he was beginning to speak cleaner
and more correct English than the officers themselves and the gentleman-adventurers
in the cabin who had financed the expedition.</p>
<p>The captain was a fishy-eyed Norwegian who somehow had fallen into
possession of a complete Shakespeare, which he never read, and Martin
had washed his clothes for him and in return been permitted access to
the precious volumes.&nbsp; For a time, so steeped was he in the plays
and in the many favorite passages that impressed themselves almost without
effort on his brain, that all the world seemed to shape itself into
forms of Elizabethan tragedy or comedy and his very thoughts were in
blank verse.&nbsp; It trained his ear and gave him a fine appreciation
for noble English; withal it introduced into his mind much that was
archaic and obsolete.</p>
<p>The eight months had been well spent, and, in addition to what he
had learned of right speaking and high thinking, he had learned much
of himself.&nbsp; Along with his humbleness because he knew so little,
there arose a conviction of power.&nbsp; He felt a sharp gradation between
himself and his shipmates, and was wise enough to realize that the difference
lay in potentiality rather than achievement.&nbsp; What he could do,&mdash;they
could do; but within him he felt a confused ferment working that told
him there was more in him than he had done.&nbsp; He was tortured by
the exquisite beauty of the world, and wished that Ruth were there to
share it with him.&nbsp; He decided that he would describe to her many
of the bits of South Sea beauty.&nbsp; The creative spirit in him flamed
up at the thought and urged that he recreate this beauty for a wider
audience than Ruth.&nbsp; And then, in splendor and glory, came the
great idea.&nbsp; He would write.&nbsp; He would be one of the eyes
through which the world saw, one of the ears through which it heard,
one of the hearts through which it felt.&nbsp; He would write&mdash;everything&mdash;poetry
and prose, fiction and description, and plays like Shakespeare.&nbsp;
There was career and the way to win to Ruth.&nbsp; The men of literature
were the world&rsquo;s giants, and he conceived them to be far finer
than the Mr. Butlers who earned thirty thousand a year and could be
Supreme Court justices if they wanted to.</p>
<p>Once the idea had germinated, it mastered him, and the return voyage
to San Francisco was like a dream.&nbsp; He was drunken with unguessed
power and felt that he could do anything.&nbsp; In the midst of the
great and lonely sea he gained perspective.&nbsp; Clearly, and for the
first lime, he saw Ruth and her world.&nbsp; It was all visualized in
his mind as a concrete thing which he could take up in his two hands
and turn around and about and examine.&nbsp; There was much that was
dim and nebulous in that world, but he saw it as a whole and not in
detail, and he saw, also, the way to master it.&nbsp; To write!&nbsp;
The thought was fire in him.&nbsp; He would begin as soon as he got
back.&nbsp; The first thing he would do would be to describe the voyage
of the treasure-hunters.&nbsp; He would sell it to some San Francisco
newspaper.&nbsp; He would not tell Ruth anything about it, and she would
be surprised and pleased when she saw his name in print.&nbsp; While
he wrote, he could go on studying.&nbsp; There were twenty-four hours
in each day.&nbsp; He was invincible.&nbsp; He knew how to work, and
the citadels would go down before him.&nbsp; He would not have to go
to sea again&mdash;as a sailor; and for the instant he caught a vision
of a steam yacht.&nbsp; There were other writers who possessed steam
yachts.&nbsp; Of course, he cautioned himself, it would be slow succeeding
at first, and for a time he would be content to earn enough money by
his writing to enable him to go on studying.&nbsp; And then, after some
time,&mdash;a very indeterminate time,&mdash;when he had learned and
prepared himself, he would write the great things and his name would
be on all men&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; But greater than that, infinitely
greater and greatest of all, he would have proved himself worthy of
Ruth.&nbsp; Fame was all very well, but it was for Ruth that his splendid
dream arose.&nbsp; He was not a fame-monger, but merely one of God&rsquo;s
mad lovers.</p>
<p>Arrived in Oakland, with his snug pay-day in his pocket, he took
up his old room at Bernard Higginbotham&rsquo;s and set to work.&nbsp;
He did not even let Ruth know he was back.&nbsp; He would go and see
her when he finished the article on the treasure-hunters.&nbsp; It was
not so difficult to abstain from seeing her, because of the violent
heat of creative fever that burned in him.&nbsp; Besides, the very article
he was writing would bring her nearer to him.&nbsp; He did not know
how long an article he should write, but he counted the words in a double-page
article in the Sunday supplement of the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i>,
and guided himself by that.&nbsp; Three days, at white heat, completed
his narrative; but when he had copied it carefully, in a large scrawl
that was easy to read, he learned from a rhetoric he picked up in the
library that there were such things as paragraphs and quotation marks.&nbsp;
He had never thought of such things before; and he promptly set to work
writing the article over, referring continually to the pages of the
rhetoric and learning more in a day about composition than the average
schoolboy in a year.&nbsp; When he had copied the article a second time
and rolled it up carefully, he read in a newspaper an item on hints
to beginners, and discovered the iron law that manuscripts should never
be rolled and that they should be written on one side of the paper.&nbsp;
He had violated the law on both counts.&nbsp; Also, he learned from
the item that first-class papers paid a minimum of ten dollars a column.&nbsp;
So, while he copied the manuscript a third time, he consoled himself
by multiplying ten columns by ten dollars.&nbsp; The product was always
the same, one hundred dollars, and he decided that that was better than
seafaring.&nbsp; If it hadn&rsquo;t been for his blunders, he would
have finished the article in three days.&nbsp; One hundred dollars in
three days!&nbsp; It would have taken him three months and longer on
the sea to earn a similar amount.&nbsp; A man was a fool to go to sea
when he could write, he concluded, though the money in itself meant
nothing to him.&nbsp; Its value was in the liberty it would get him,
the presentable garments it would buy him, all of which would bring
him nearer, swiftly nearer, to the slender, pale girl who had turned
his life back upon itself and given him inspiration.</p>
<p>He mailed the manuscript in a flat envelope, and addressed it to
the editor of the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i>.&nbsp; He had an idea
that anything accepted by a paper was published immediately, and as
he had sent the manuscript in on Friday he expected it to come out on
the following Sunday.&nbsp; He conceived that it would be fine to let
that event apprise Ruth of his return.&nbsp; Then, Sunday afternoon,
he would call and see her.&nbsp; In the meantime he was occupied by
another idea, which he prided himself upon as being a particularly sane,
careful, and modest idea.&nbsp; He would write an adventure story for
boys and sell it to <i>The Youth&rsquo;s Companion</i>.&nbsp; He went
to the free reading-room and looked through the files of <i>The Youth&rsquo;s
Companion</i>.&nbsp; Serial stories, he found, were usually published
in that weekly in five instalments of about three thousand words each.&nbsp;
He discovered several serials that ran to seven instalments, and decided
to write one of that length.</p>
<p>He had been on a whaling voyage in the Arctic, once&mdash;a voyage
that was to have been for three years and which had terminated in shipwreck
at the end of six months.&nbsp; While his imagination was fanciful,
even fantastic at times, he had a basic love of reality that compelled
him to write about the things he knew.&nbsp; He knew whaling, and out
of the real materials of his knowledge he proceeded to manufacture the
fictitious adventures of the two boys he intended to use as joint heroes.&nbsp;
It was easy work, he decided on Saturday evening.&nbsp; He had completed
on that day the first instalment of three thousand words&mdash;much
to the amusement of Jim, and to the open derision of Mr. Higginbotham,
who sneered throughout meal-time at the &ldquo;litery&rdquo; person
they had discovered in the family.</p>
<p>Martin contented himself by picturing his brother-in-law&rsquo;s
surprise on Sunday morning when he opened his <i>Examiner</i> and saw
the article on the treasure-hunters.&nbsp; Early that morning he was
out himself to the front door, nervously racing through the many-sheeted
newspaper.&nbsp; He went through it a second time, very carefully, then
folded it up and left it where he had found it.&nbsp; He was glad he
had not told any one about his article.&nbsp; On second thought he concluded
that he had been wrong about the speed with which things found their
way into newspaper columns.&nbsp; Besides, there had not been any news
value in his article, and most likely the editor would write to him
about it first.</p>
<p>After breakfast he went on with his serial.&nbsp; The words flowed
from his pen, though he broke off from the writing frequently to look
up definitions in the dictionary or to refer to the rhetoric.&nbsp;
He often read or re-read a chapter at a time, during such pauses; and
he consoled himself that while he was not writing the great things he
felt to be in him, he was learning composition, at any rate, and training
himself to shape up and express his thoughts.&nbsp; He toiled on till
dark, when he went out to the reading-room and explored magazines and
weeklies until the place closed at ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; This was
his programme for a week.&nbsp; Each day he did three thousand words,
and each evening he puzzled his way through the magazines, taking note
of the stories, articles, and poems that editors saw fit to publish.&nbsp;
One thing was certain: What these multitudinous writers did he could
do, and only give him time and he would do what they could not do.&nbsp;
He was cheered to read in <i>Book News</i>, in a paragraph on the payment
of magazine writers, not that Rudyard Kipling received a dollar per
word, but that the minimum rate paid by first-class magazines was two
cents a word.&nbsp; <i>The Youth&rsquo;s Companion</i> was certainly
first class, and at that rate the three thousand words he had written
that day would bring him sixty dollars&mdash;two months&rsquo; wages
on the sea!</p>
<p>On Friday night he finished the serial, twenty-one thousand words
long.&nbsp; At two cents a word, he calculated, that would bring him
four hundred and twenty dollars.&nbsp; Not a bad week&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;
It was more money than he had ever possessed at one time.&nbsp; He did
not know how he could spend it all.&nbsp; He had tapped a gold mine.&nbsp;
Where this came from he could always get more.&nbsp; He planned to buy
some more clothes, to subscribe to many magazines, and to buy dozens
of reference books that at present he was compelled to go to the library
to consult.&nbsp; And still there was a large portion of the four hundred
and twenty dollars unspent.&nbsp; This worried him until the thought
came to him of hiring a servant for Gertrude and of buying a bicycle
for Marion.</p>
<p>He mailed the bulky manuscript to <i>The Youth&rsquo;s Companion</i>,
and on Saturday afternoon, after having planned an article on pearl-diving,
he went to see Ruth.&nbsp; He had telephoned, and she went herself to
greet him at the door.&nbsp; The old familiar blaze of health rushed
out from him and struck her like a blow.&nbsp; It seemed to enter into
her body and course through her veins in a liquid glow, and to set her
quivering with its imparted strength.&nbsp; He flushed warmly as he
took her hand and looked into her blue eyes, but the fresh bronze of
eight months of sun hid the flush, though it did not protect the neck
from the gnawing chafe of the stiff collar.&nbsp; She noted the red
line of it with amusement which quickly vanished as she glanced at his
clothes.&nbsp; They really fitted him,&mdash;it was his first made-to-order
suit,&mdash;and he seemed slimmer and better modelled.&nbsp; In addition,
his cloth cap had been replaced by a soft hat, which she commanded him
to put on and then complimented him on his appearance.&nbsp; She did
not remember when she had felt so happy.&nbsp; This change in him was
her handiwork, and she was proud of it and fired with ambition further
to help him.</p>
<p>But the most radical change of all, and the one that pleased her
most, was the change in his speech.&nbsp; Not only did he speak more
correctly, but he spoke more easily, and there were many new words in
his vocabulary.&nbsp; When he grew excited or enthusiastic, however,
he dropped back into the old slurring and the dropping of final consonants.&nbsp;
Also, there was an awkward hesitancy, at times, as he essayed the new
words he had learned.&nbsp; On the other hand, along with his ease of
expression, he displayed a lightness and facetiousness of thought that
delighted her.&nbsp; It was his old spirit of humor and badinage that
had made him a favorite in his own class, but which he had hitherto
been unable to use in her presence through lack of words and training.&nbsp;
He was just beginning to orientate himself and to feel that he was not
wholly an intruder.&nbsp; But he was very tentative, fastidiously so,
letting Ruth set the pace of sprightliness and fancy, keeping up with
her but never daring to go beyond her.</p>
<p>He told her of what he had been doing, and of his plan to write for
a livelihood and of going on with his studies.&nbsp; But he was disappointed
at her lack of approval.&nbsp; She did not think much of his plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said frankly, &ldquo;writing must be a
trade, like anything else.&nbsp; Not that I know anything about it,
of course.&nbsp; I only bring common judgment to bear.&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t
hope to be a blacksmith without spending three years at learning the
trade&mdash;or is it five years!&nbsp; Now writers are so much better
paid than blacksmiths that there must be ever so many more men who would
like to write, who&mdash;try to write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then, may not I be peculiarly constituted to write?&rdquo;
he queried, secretly exulting at the language he had used, his swift
imagination throwing the whole scene and atmosphere upon a vast screen
along with a thousand other scenes from his life&mdash;scenes that were
rough and raw, gross and bestial.</p>
<p>The whole composite vision was achieved with the speed of light,
producing no pause in the conversation, nor interrupting his calm train
of thought.&nbsp; On the screen of his imagination he saw himself and
this sweet and beautiful girl, facing each other and conversing in good
English, in a room of books and paintings and tone and culture, and
all illuminated by a bright light of steadfast brilliance; while ranged
about and fading away to the remote edges of the screen were antithetical
scenes, each scene a picture, and he the onlooker, free to look at will
upon what he wished.&nbsp; He saw these other scenes through drifting
vapors and swirls of sullen fog dissolving before shafts of red and
garish light.&nbsp; He saw cowboys at the bar, drinking fierce whiskey,
the air filled with obscenity and ribald language, and he saw himself
with them drinking and cursing with the wildest, or sitting at table
with them, under smoking kerosene lamps, while the chips clicked and
clattered and the cards were dealt around.&nbsp; He saw himself, stripped
to the waist, with naked fists, fighting his great fight with Liverpool
Red in the forecastle of the <i>Susquehanna</i>; and he saw the bloody
deck of the <i>John Rogers</i>, that gray morning of attempted mutiny,
the mate kicking in death-throes on the main-hatch, the revolver in
the old man&rsquo;s hand spitting fire and smoke, the men with passion-wrenched
faces, of brutes screaming vile blasphemies and falling about him&mdash;and
then he returned to the central scene, calm and clean in the steadfast
light, where Ruth sat and talked with him amid books and paintings;
and he saw the grand piano upon which she would later play to him; and
he heard the echoes of his own selected and correct words, &ldquo;But
then, may I not be peculiarly constituted to write?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no matter how peculiarly constituted a man may be for
blacksmithing,&rdquo; she was laughing, &ldquo;I never heard of one
becoming a blacksmith without first serving his apprenticeship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you advise?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t
forget that I feel in me this capacity to write&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
explain it; I just know that it is in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must get a thorough education,&rdquo; was the answer,
&ldquo;whether or not you ultimately become a writer.&nbsp; This education
is indispensable for whatever career you select, and it must not be
slipshod or sketchy.&nbsp; You should go to high school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;&rdquo; he began; but she interrupted with an afterthought:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you could go on with your writing, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have to,&rdquo; he said grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked at him, prettily puzzled, for
she did not quite like the persistence with which he clung to his notion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, without writing there wouldn&rsquo;t be any high
school.&nbsp; I must live and buy books and clothes, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten that,&rdquo; she laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
weren&rsquo;t you born with an income?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have good health and imagination,&rdquo;
he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can make good on the income, but the other
things have to be made good for&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He almost said &ldquo;you,&rdquo;
then amended his sentence to, &ldquo;have to be made good for one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;make good,&rsquo;&rdquo; she cried,
sweetly petulant.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s slang, and it&rsquo;s horrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flushed, and stammered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, and I only
wish you&rsquo;d correct me every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; she said haltingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have so much in you that is good that I want to see you perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was clay in her hands immediately, as passionately desirous of
being moulded by her as she was desirous of shaping him into the image
of her ideal of man.&nbsp; And when she pointed out the opportuneness
of the time, that the entrance examinations to high school began on
the following Monday, he promptly volunteered that he would take them.</p>
<p>Then she played and sang to him, while he gazed with hungry yearning
at her, drinking in her loveliness and marvelling that there should
not be a hundred suitors listening there and longing for her as he listened
and longed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>He stopped to dinner that evening, and, much to Ruth&rsquo;s satisfaction,
made a favorable impression on her father.&nbsp; They talked about the
sea as a career, a subject which Martin had at his finger-ends, and
Mr. Morse remarked afterward that he seemed a very clear-headed young
man.&nbsp; In his avoidance of slang and his search after right words,
Martin was compelled to talk slowly, which enabled him to find the best
thoughts that were in him.&nbsp; He was more at ease than that first
night at dinner, nearly a year before, and his shyness and modesty even
commended him to Mrs. Morse, who was pleased at his manifest improvement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the first man that ever drew passing notice from Ruth,&rdquo;
she told her husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has been so singularly backward
where men are concerned that I have been worried greatly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Morse looked at his wife curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to use this young sailor to wake her up?&rdquo; he
questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that she is not to die an old maid if I can help it,&rdquo;
was the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;If this young Eden can arouse her interest
in mankind in general, it will be a good thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very good thing,&rdquo; he commented.&nbsp; &ldquo;But suppose,&mdash;and
we must suppose, sometimes, my dear,&mdash;suppose he arouses her interest
too particularly in him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; Mrs. Morse laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is
three years older than he, and, besides, it is impossible.&nbsp; Nothing
will ever come of it.&nbsp; Trust that to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Martin&rsquo;s r&ocirc;le was arranged for him, while he,
led on by Arthur and Norman, was meditating an extravagance.&nbsp; They
were going out for a ride into the hills Sunday morning on their wheels,
which did not interest Martin until he learned that Ruth, too, rode
a wheel and was going along.&nbsp; He did not ride, nor own a wheel,
but if Ruth rode, it was up to him to begin, was his decision; and when
he said good night, he stopped in at a cyclery on his way home and spent
forty dollars for a wheel.&nbsp; It was more than a month&rsquo;s hard-earned
wages, and it reduced his stock of money amazingly; but when he added
the hundred dollars he was to receive from the <i>Examiner</i> to the
four hundred and twenty dollars that was the least <i>The Youth&rsquo;s
Companion</i> could pay him, he felt that he had reduced the perplexity
the unwonted amount of money had caused him.&nbsp; Nor did he mind,
in the course of learning to ride the wheel home, the fact that he ruined
his suit of clothes.&nbsp; He caught the tailor by telephone that night
from Mr. Higginbotham&rsquo;s store and ordered another suit.&nbsp;
Then he carried the wheel up the narrow stairway that clung like a fire-escape
to the rear wall of the building, and when he had moved his bed out
from the wall, found there was just space enough in the small room for
himself and the wheel.</p>
<p>Sunday he had intended to devote to studying for the high school
examination, but the pearl-diving article lured him away, and he spent
the day in the white-hot fever of re-creating the beauty and romance
that burned in him.&nbsp; The fact that the <i>Examiner</i> of that
morning had failed to publish his treasure-hunting article did not dash
his spirits.&nbsp; He was at too great a height for that, and having
been deaf to a twice-repeated summons, he went without the heavy Sunday
dinner with which Mr. Higginbotham invariably graced his table.&nbsp;
To Mr. Higginbotham such a dinner was advertisement of his worldly achievement
and prosperity, and he honored it by delivering platitudinous sermonettes
upon American institutions and the opportunity said institutions gave
to any hard-working man to rise&mdash;the rise, in his case, which he
pointed out unfailingly, being from a grocer&rsquo;s clerk to the ownership
of Higginbotham&rsquo;s Cash Store.</p>
<p>Martin Eden looked with a sigh at his unfinished &ldquo;Pearl-diving&rdquo;
on Monday morning, and took the car down to Oakland to the high school.&nbsp;
And when, days later, he applied for the results of his examinations,
he learned that he had failed in everything save grammar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your grammar is excellent,&rdquo; Professor Hilton informed
him, staring at him through heavy spectacles; &ldquo;but you know nothing,
positively nothing, in the other branches, and your United States history
is abominable&mdash;there is no other word for it, abominable.&nbsp;
I should advise you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Hilton paused and glared at him, unsympathetic and unimaginative
as one of his own test-tubes.&nbsp; He was professor of physics in the
high school, possessor of a large family, a meagre salary, and a select
fund of parrot-learned knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Martin said humbly, wishing somehow that
the man at the desk in the library was in Professor Hilton&rsquo;s place
just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I should advise you to go back to the grammar school for
at least two years.&nbsp; Good day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin was not deeply affected by his failure, though he was surprised
at Ruth&rsquo;s shocked expression when he told her Professor Hilton&rsquo;s
advice.&nbsp; Her disappointment was so evident that he was sorry he
had failed, but chiefly so for her sake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see I was right,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know
far more than any of the students entering high school, and yet you
can&rsquo;t pass the examinations.&nbsp; It is because what education
you have is fragmentary, sketchy.&nbsp; You need the discipline of study,
such as only skilled teachers can give you.&nbsp; You must be thoroughly
grounded.&nbsp; Professor Hilton is right, and if I were you, I&rsquo;d
go to night school.&nbsp; A year and a half of it might enable you to
catch up that additional six months.&nbsp; Besides, that would leave
you your days in which to write, or, if you could not make your living
by your pen, you would have your days in which to work in some position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if my days are taken up with work and my nights with school,
when am I going to see you?&mdash;was Martin&rsquo;s first thought,
though he refrained from uttering it.&nbsp; Instead, he said:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so babyish for me to be going to night school.&nbsp;
But I wouldn&rsquo;t mind that if I thought it would pay.&nbsp; But
I don&rsquo;t think it will pay.&nbsp; I can do the work quicker than
they can teach me.&nbsp; It would be a loss of time&mdash;&rdquo; he
thought of her and his desire to have her&mdash;&ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t
afford the time.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t the time to spare, in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is so much that is necessary.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked
at him gently, and he was a brute to oppose her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Physics
and chemistry&mdash;you can&rsquo;t do them without laboratory study;
and you&rsquo;ll find algebra and geometry almost hopeless without instruction.&nbsp;
You need the skilled teachers, the specialists in the art of imparting
knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent for a minute, casting about for the least vainglorious
way in which to express himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m bragging,&rdquo; he began.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend it that way at all.&nbsp; But I have a feeling
that I am what I may call a natural student.&nbsp; I can study by myself.&nbsp;
I take to it kindly, like a duck to water.&nbsp; You see yourself what
I did with grammar.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve learned much of other things&mdash;you
would never dream how much.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m only getting started.&nbsp;
Wait till I get&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He hesitated and assured himself
of the pronunciation before he said &ldquo;momentum.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
getting my first real feel of things now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m beginning
to size up the situation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;size up,&rsquo;&rdquo; she interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get a line on things,&rdquo; he hastily amended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean anything in correct English,&rdquo;
she objected.</p>
<p>He floundered for a fresh start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m driving at is that I&rsquo;m beginning to get
the lay of the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out of pity she forebore, and he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowledge seems to me like a chart-room.&nbsp; Whenever I
go into the library, I am impressed that way.&nbsp; The part played
by teachers is to teach the student the contents of the chart-room in
a systematic way.&nbsp; The teachers are guides to the chart-room, that&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not something that they have in their own heads.&nbsp;
They don&rsquo;t make it up, don&rsquo;t create it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
all in the chart-room and they know their way about in it, and it&rsquo;s
their business to show the place to strangers who might else get lost.&nbsp;
Now I don&rsquo;t get lost easily.&nbsp; I have the bump of location.&nbsp;
I usually know where I&rsquo;m at&mdash;What&rsquo;s wrong now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;where I&rsquo;m at.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he said gratefully, &ldquo;where
I am.&nbsp; But where am I at&mdash;I mean, where am I?&nbsp; Oh, yes,
in the chart-room.&nbsp; Well, some people&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Persons,&rdquo; she corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some persons need guides, most persons do; but I think I can
get along without them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in the
chart-room now, and I&rsquo;m on the edge of knowing my way about, what
charts I want to refer to, what coasts I want to explore.&nbsp; And
from the way I line it up, I&rsquo;ll explore a whole lot more quickly
by myself.&nbsp; The speed of a fleet, you know, is the speed of the
slowest ship, and the speed of the teachers is affected the same way.&nbsp;
They can&rsquo;t go any faster than the ruck of their scholars, and
I can set a faster pace for myself than they set for a whole schoolroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He travels the fastest who travels alone,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she quoted at him.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d travel faster with you just the same, was what he wanted
to blurt out, as he caught a vision of a world without end of sunlit
spaces and starry voids through which he drifted with her, his arm around
her, her pale gold hair blowing about his face.&nbsp; In the same instant
he was aware of the pitiful inadequacy of speech.&nbsp; God!&nbsp; If
he could so frame words that she could see what he then saw!&nbsp; And
he felt the stir in him, like a throe of yearning pain, of the desire
to paint these visions that flashed unsummoned on the mirror of his
mind.&nbsp; Ah, that was it!&nbsp; He caught at the hem of the secret.&nbsp;
It was the very thing that the great writers and master-poets did.&nbsp;
That was why they were giants.&nbsp; They knew how to express what they
thought, and felt, and saw.&nbsp; Dogs asleep in the sun often whined
and barked, but they were unable to tell what they saw that made them
whine and bark.&nbsp; He had often wondered what it was.&nbsp; And that
was all he was, a dog asleep in the sun.&nbsp; He saw noble and beautiful
visions, but he could only whine and bark at Ruth.&nbsp; But he would
cease sleeping in the sun.&nbsp; He would stand up, with open eyes,
and he would struggle and toil and learn until, with eyes unblinded
and tongue untied, he could share with her his visioned wealth.&nbsp;
Other men had discovered the trick of expression, of making words obedient
servitors, and of making combinations of words mean more than the sum
of their separate meanings.&nbsp; He was stirred profoundly by the passing
glimpse at the secret, and he was again caught up in the vision of sunlit
spaces and starry voids&mdash;until it came to him that it was very
quiet, and he saw Ruth regarding him with an amused expression and a
smile in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had a great visioning,&rdquo; he said, and at the sound
of his words in his own ears his heart gave a leap.&nbsp; Where had
those words come from?&nbsp; They had adequately expressed the pause
his vision had put in the conversation.&nbsp; It was a miracle.&nbsp;
Never had he so loftily framed a lofty thought.&nbsp; But never had
he attempted to frame lofty thoughts in words.&nbsp; That was it.&nbsp;
That explained it.&nbsp; He had never tried.&nbsp; But Swinburne had,
and Tennyson, and Kipling, and all the other poets.&nbsp; His mind flashed
on to his &ldquo;Pearl-diving.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had never dared the big
things, the spirit of the beauty that was a fire in him.&nbsp; That
article would be a different thing when he was done with it.&nbsp; He
was appalled by the vastness of the beauty that rightfully belonged
in it, and again his mind flashed and dared, and he demanded of himself
why he could not chant that beauty in noble verse as the great poets
did.&nbsp; And there was all the mysterious delight and spiritual wonder
of his love for Ruth.&nbsp; Why could he not chant that, too, as the
poets did?&nbsp; They had sung of love.&nbsp; So would he.&nbsp; By
God!&mdash;</p>
<p>And in his frightened ears he heard his exclamation echoing.&nbsp;
Carried away, he had breathed it aloud.&nbsp; The blood surged into
his face, wave upon wave, mastering the bronze of it till the blush
of shame flaunted itself from collar-rim to the roots of his hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;beg your pardon,&rdquo; he stammered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounded as if you were praying,&rdquo; she said bravely,
but she felt herself inside to be withering and shrinking.&nbsp; It
was the first time she had heard an oath from the lips of a man she
knew, and she was shocked, not merely as a matter of principle and training,
but shocked in spirit by this rough blast of life in the garden of her
sheltered maidenhood.</p>
<p>But she forgave, and with surprise at the ease of her forgiveness.&nbsp;
Somehow it was not so difficult to forgive him anything.&nbsp; He had
not had a chance to be as other men, and he was trying so hard, and
succeeding, too.&nbsp; It never entered her head that there could be
any other reason for her being kindly disposed toward him.&nbsp; She
was tenderly disposed toward him, but she did not know it.&nbsp; She
had no way of knowing it.&nbsp; The placid poise of twenty-four years
without a single love affair did not fit her with a keen perception
of her own feelings, and she who had never warmed to actual love was
unaware that she was warming now.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>Martin went back to his pearl-diving article, which would have been
finished sooner if it had not been broken in upon so frequently by his
attempts to write poetry.&nbsp; His poems were love poems, inspired
by Ruth, but they were never completed.&nbsp; Not in a day could he
learn to chant in noble verse.&nbsp; Rhyme and metre and structure were
serious enough in themselves, but there was, over and beyond them, an
intangible and evasive something that he caught in all great poetry,
but which he could not catch and imprison in his own.&nbsp; It was the
elusive spirit of poetry itself that he sensed and sought after but
could not capture.&nbsp; It seemed a glow to him, a warm and trailing
vapor, ever beyond his reaching, though sometimes he was rewarded by
catching at shreds of it and weaving them into phrases that echoed in
his brain with haunting notes or drifted across his vision in misty
wafture of unseen beauty.&nbsp; It was baffling.&nbsp; He ached with
desire to express and could but gibber prosaically as everybody gibbered.&nbsp;
He read his fragments aloud.&nbsp; The metre marched along on perfect
feet, and the rhyme pounded a longer and equally faultless rhythm, but
the glow and high exaltation that he felt within were lacking.&nbsp;
He could not understand, and time and again, in despair, defeated and
depressed, he returned to his article.&nbsp; Prose was certainly an
easier medium.</p>
<p>Following the &ldquo;Pearl-diving,&rdquo; he wrote an article on
the sea as a career, another on turtle-catching, and a third on the
northeast trades.&nbsp; Then he tried, as an experiment, a short story,
and before he broke his stride he had finished six short stories and
despatched them to various magazines.&nbsp; He wrote prolifically, intensely,
from morning till night, and late at night, except when he broke off
to go to the reading-room, draw books from the library, or to call on
Ruth.&nbsp; He was profoundly happy.&nbsp; Life was pitched high.&nbsp;
He was in a fever that never broke.&nbsp; The joy of creation that is
supposed to belong to the gods was his.&nbsp; All the life about him&mdash;the
odors of stale vegetables and soapsuds, the slatternly form of his sister,
and the jeering face of Mr. Higginbotham&mdash;was a dream.&nbsp; The
real world was in his mind, and the stories he wrote were so many pieces
of reality out of his mind.</p>
<p>The days were too short.&nbsp; There was so much he wanted to study.&nbsp;
He cut his sleep down to five hours and found that he could get along
upon it.&nbsp; He tried four hours and a half, and regretfully came
back to five.&nbsp; He could joyfully have spent all his waking hours
upon any one of his pursuits.&nbsp; It was with regret that he ceased
from writing to study, that he ceased from study to go to the library,
that he tore himself away from that chart-room of knowledge or from
the magazines in the reading-room that were filled with the secrets
of writers who succeeded in selling their wares.&nbsp; It was like severing
heart strings, when he was with Ruth, to stand up and go; and he scorched
through the dark streets so as to get home to his books at the least
possible expense of time.&nbsp; And hardest of all was it to shut up
the algebra or physics, put note-book and pencil aside, and close his
tired eyes in sleep.&nbsp; He hated the thought of ceasing to live,
even for so short a time, and his sole consolation was that the alarm
clock was set five hours ahead.&nbsp; He would lose only five hours
anyway, and then the jangling bell would jerk him out of unconsciousness
and he would have before him another glorious day of nineteen hours.</p>
<p>In the meantime the weeks were passing, his money was ebbing low,
and there was no money coming in.&nbsp; A month after he had mailed
it, the adventure serial for boys was returned to him by <i>The Youth&rsquo;s
Companion</i>.&nbsp; The rejection slip was so tactfully worded that
he felt kindly toward the editor.&nbsp; But he did not feel so kindly
toward the editor of the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i>.&nbsp; After
waiting two whole weeks, Martin had written to him.&nbsp; A week later
he wrote again.&nbsp; At the end of the month, he went over to San Francisco
and personally called upon the editor.&nbsp; But he did not meet that
exalted personage, thanks to a Cerberus of an office boy, of tender
years and red hair, who guarded the portals.&nbsp; At the end of the
fifth week the manuscript came back to him, by mail, without comment.&nbsp;
There was no rejection slip, no explanation, nothing.&nbsp; In the same
way his other articles were tied up with the other leading San Francisco
papers.&nbsp; When he recovered them, he sent them to the magazines
in the East, from which they were returned more promptly, accompanied
always by the printed rejection slips.</p>
<p>The short stories were returned in similar fashion.&nbsp; He read
them over and over, and liked them so much that he could not puzzle
out the cause of their rejection, until, one day, he read in a newspaper
that manuscripts should always be typewritten.&nbsp; That explained
it.&nbsp; Of course editors were so busy that they could not afford
the time and strain of reading handwriting.&nbsp; Martin rented a typewriter
and spent a day mastering the machine.&nbsp; Each day he typed what
he composed, and he typed his earlier manuscripts as fast as they were
returned him.&nbsp; He was surprised when the typed ones began to come
back.&nbsp; His jaw seemed to become squarer, his chin more aggressive,
and he bundled the manuscripts off to new editors.</p>
<p>The thought came to him that he was not a good judge of his own work.&nbsp;
He tried it out on Gertrude.&nbsp; He read his stories aloud to her.&nbsp;
Her eyes glistened, and she looked at him proudly as she said:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it grand, you writin&rsquo; those sort of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he demanded impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
the story&mdash;how did you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just grand,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just grand,
an&rsquo; thrilling, too.&nbsp; I was all worked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could see that her mind was not clear.&nbsp; The perplexity was
strong in her good-natured face.&nbsp; So he waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, say, Mart,&rdquo; after a long pause, &ldquo;how did
it end?&nbsp; Did that young man who spoke so highfalutin&rsquo; get
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, after he had explained the end, which he thought he had made
artistically obvious, she would say:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I wanted to know.&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t
you write that way in the story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing he learned, after he had read her a number of stories,
namely, that she liked happy endings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That story was perfectly grand,&rdquo; she announced, straightening
up from the wash-tub with a tired sigh and wiping the sweat from her
forehead with a red, steamy hand; &ldquo;but it makes me sad.&nbsp;
I want to cry.&nbsp; There is too many sad things in the world anyway.&nbsp;
It makes me happy to think about happy things.&nbsp; Now if he&rsquo;d
married her, and&mdash;You don&rsquo;t mind, Mart?&rdquo; she queried
apprehensively.&nbsp; &ldquo;I just happen to feel that way, because
I&rsquo;m tired, I guess.&nbsp; But the story was grand just the same,
perfectly grand.&nbsp; Where are you goin&rsquo; to sell it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a horse of another color,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you <i>did</i> sell it, what do you think you&rsquo;d
get for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a hundred dollars.&nbsp; That would be the least, the
way prices go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My!&nbsp; I do hope you&rsquo;ll sell it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy money, eh?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he added proudly: &ldquo;I
wrote it in two days.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s fifty dollars a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He longed to read his stories to Ruth, but did not dare.&nbsp; He
would wait till some were published, he decided, then she would understand
what he had been working for.&nbsp; In the meantime he toiled on.&nbsp;
Never had the spirit of adventure lured him more strongly than on this
amazing exploration of the realm of mind.&nbsp; He bought the text-books
on physics and chemistry, and, along with his algebra, worked out problems
and demonstrations.&nbsp; He took the laboratory proofs on faith, and
his intense power of vision enabled him to see the reactions of chemicals
more understandingly than the average student saw them in the laboratory.&nbsp;
Martin wandered on through the heavy pages, overwhelmed by the clews
he was getting to the nature of things.&nbsp; He had accepted the world
as the world, but now he was comprehending the organization of it, the
play and interplay of force and matter.&nbsp; Spontaneous explanations
of old matters were continually arising in his mind.&nbsp; Levers and
purchases fascinated him, and his mind roved backward to hand-spikes
and blocks and tackles at sea.&nbsp; The theory of navigation, which
enabled the ships to travel unerringly their courses over the pathless
ocean, was made clear to him.&nbsp; The mysteries of storm, and rain,
and tide were revealed, and the reason for the existence of trade-winds
made him wonder whether he had written his article on the northeast
trade too soon.&nbsp; At any rate he knew he could write it better now.&nbsp;
One afternoon he went out with Arthur to the University of California,
and, with bated breath and a feeling of religious awe, went through
the laboratories, saw demonstrations, and listened to a physics professor
lecturing to his classes.</p>
<p>But he did not neglect his writing.&nbsp; A stream of short stories
flowed from his pen, and he branched out into the easier forms of verse&mdash;the
kind he saw printed in the magazines&mdash;though he lost his head and
wasted two weeks on a tragedy in blank verse, the swift rejection of
which, by half a dozen magazines, dumfounded him.&nbsp; Then he discovered
Henley and wrote a series of sea-poems on the model of &ldquo;Hospital
Sketches.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were simple poems, of light and color, and
romance and adventure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sea Lyrics,&rdquo; he called them,
and he judged them to be the best work he had yet done.&nbsp; There
were thirty, and he completed them in a month, doing one a day after
having done his regular day&rsquo;s work on fiction, which day&rsquo;s
work was the equivalent to a week&rsquo;s work of the average successful
writer.&nbsp; The toil meant nothing to him.&nbsp; It was not toil.&nbsp;
He was finding speech, and all the beauty and wonder that had been pent
for years behind his inarticulate lips was now pouring forth in a wild
and virile flood.</p>
<p>He showed the &ldquo;Sea Lyrics&rdquo; to no one, not even to the
editors.&nbsp; He had become distrustful of editors.&nbsp; But it was
not distrust that prevented him from submitting the &ldquo;Lyrics.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They were so beautiful to him that he was impelled to save them to share
with Ruth in some glorious, far-off time when he would dare to read
to her what he had written.&nbsp; Against that time he kept them with
him, reading them aloud, going over them until he knew them by heart.</p>
<p>He lived every moment of his waking hours, and he lived in his sleep,
his subjective mind rioting through his five hours of surcease and combining
the thoughts and events of the day into grotesque and impossible marvels.&nbsp;
In reality, he never rested, and a weaker body or a less firmly poised
brain would have been prostrated in a general break-down.&nbsp; His
late afternoon calls on Ruth were rarer now, for June was approaching,
when she would take her degree and finish with the university.&nbsp;
Bachelor of Arts!&mdash;when he thought of her degree, it seemed she
fled beyond him faster than he could pursue.</p>
<p>One afternoon a week she gave to him, and arriving late, he usually
stayed for dinner and for music afterward.&nbsp; Those were his red-letter
days.&nbsp; The atmosphere of the house, in such contrast with that
in which he lived, and the mere nearness to her, sent him forth each
time with a firmer grip on his resolve to climb the heights.&nbsp; In
spite of the beauty in him, and the aching desire to create, it was
for her that he struggled.&nbsp; He was a lover first and always.&nbsp;
All other things he subordinated to love.</p>
<p>Greater than his adventure in the world of thought was his love-adventure.&nbsp;
The world itself was not so amazing because of the atoms and molecules
that composed it according to the propulsions of irresistible force;
what made it amazing was the fact that Ruth lived in it.&nbsp; She was
the most amazing thing he had ever known, or dreamed, or guessed.</p>
<p>But he was oppressed always by her remoteness.&nbsp; She was so far
from him, and he did not know how to approach her.&nbsp; He had been
a success with girls and women in his own class; but he had never loved
any of them, while he did love her, and besides, she was not merely
of another class.&nbsp; His very love elevated her above all classes.&nbsp;
She was a being apart, so far apart that he did not know how to draw
near to her as a lover should draw near.&nbsp; It was true, as he acquired
knowledge and language, that he was drawing nearer, talking her speech,
discovering ideas and delights in common; but this did not satisfy his
lover&rsquo;s yearning.&nbsp; His lover&rsquo;s imagination had made
her holy, too holy, too spiritualized, to have any kinship with him
in the flesh.&nbsp; It was his own love that thrust her from him and
made her seem impossible for him.&nbsp; Love itself denied him the one
thing that it desired.</p>
<p>And then, one day, without warning, the gulf between them was bridged
for a moment, and thereafter, though the gulf remained, it was ever
narrower.&nbsp; They had been eating cherries&mdash;great, luscious,
black cherries with a juice of the color of dark wine.&nbsp; And later,
as she read aloud to him from &ldquo;The Princess,&rdquo; he chanced
to notice the stain of the cherries on her lips.&nbsp; For the moment
her divinity was shattered.&nbsp; She was clay, after all, mere clay,
subject to the common law of clay as his clay was subject, or anybody&rsquo;s
clay.&nbsp; Her lips were flesh like his, and cherries dyed them as
cherries dyed his.&nbsp; And if so with her lips, then was it so with
all of her.&nbsp; She was woman, all woman, just like any woman.&nbsp;
It came upon him abruptly.&nbsp; It was a revelation that stunned him.&nbsp;
It was as if he had seen the sun fall out of the sky, or had seen worshipped
purity polluted.</p>
<p>Then he realized the significance of it, and his heart began pounding
and challenging him to play the lover with this woman who was not a
spirit from other worlds but a mere woman with lips a cherry could stain.&nbsp;
He trembled at the audacity of his thought; but all his soul was singing,
and reason, in a triumphant paean, assured him he was right.&nbsp; Something
of this change in him must have reached her, for she paused from her
reading, looked up at him, and smiled.&nbsp; His eyes dropped from her
blue eyes to her lips, and the sight of the stain maddened him.&nbsp;
His arms all but flashed out to her and around her, in the way of his
old careless life.&nbsp; She seemed to lean toward him, to wait, and
all his will fought to hold him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were not following a word,&rdquo; she pouted.</p>
<p>Then she laughed at him, delighting in his confusion, and as he looked
into her frank eyes and knew that she had divined nothing of what he
felt, he became abashed.&nbsp; He had indeed in thought dared too far.&nbsp;
Of all the women he had known there was no woman who would not have
guessed&mdash;save her.&nbsp; And she had not guessed.&nbsp; There was
the difference.&nbsp; She was different.&nbsp; He was appalled by his
own grossness, awed by her clear innocence, and he gazed again at her
across the gulf.&nbsp; The bridge had broken down.</p>
<p>But still the incident had brought him nearer.&nbsp; The memory of
it persisted, and in the moments when he was most cast down, he dwelt
upon it eagerly.&nbsp; The gulf was never again so wide.&nbsp; He had
accomplished a distance vastly greater than a bachelorship of arts,
or a dozen bachelorships.&nbsp; She was pure, it was true, as he had
never dreamed of purity; but cherries stained her lips.&nbsp; She was
subject to the laws of the universe just as inexorably as he was.&nbsp;
She had to eat to live, and when she got her feet wet, she caught cold.&nbsp;
But that was not the point.&nbsp; If she could feel hunger and thirst,
and heat and cold, then could she feel love&mdash;and love for a man.&nbsp;
Well, he was a man.&nbsp; And why could he not be the man?&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
up to me to make good,&rdquo; he would murmur fervently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will be <i>the</i> man.&nbsp; I will make myself <i>the</i> man.&nbsp;
I will make good.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>Early one evening, struggling with a sonnet that twisted all awry
the beauty and thought that trailed in glow and vapor through his brain,
Martin was called to the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lady&rsquo;s voice, a fine lady&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
Mr. Higginbotham, who had called him, jeered.</p>
<p>Martin went to the telephone in the corner of the room, and felt
a wave of warmth rush through him as he heard Ruth&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp;
In his battle with the sonnet he had forgotten her existence, and at
the sound of her voice his love for her smote him like a sudden blow.&nbsp;
And such a voice!&mdash;delicate and sweet, like a strain of music heard
far off and faint, or, better, like a bell of silver, a perfect tone,
crystal-pure.&nbsp; No mere woman had a voice like that.&nbsp; There
was something celestial about it, and it came from other worlds.&nbsp;
He could scarcely hear what it said, so ravished was he, though he controlled
his face, for he knew that Mr. Higginbotham&rsquo;s ferret eyes were
fixed upon him.</p>
<p>It was not much that Ruth wanted to say&mdash;merely that Norman
had been going to take her to a lecture that night, but that he had
a headache, and she was so disappointed, and she had the tickets, and
that if he had no other engagement, would he be good enough to take
her?</p>
<p>Would he!&nbsp; He fought to suppress the eagerness in his voice.&nbsp;
It was amazing.&nbsp; He had always seen her in her own house.&nbsp;
And he had never dared to ask her to go anywhere with him.&nbsp; Quite
irrelevantly, still at the telephone and talking with her, he felt an
overpowering desire to die for her, and visions of heroic sacrifice
shaped and dissolved in his whirling brain.&nbsp; He loved her so much,
so terribly, so hopelessly.&nbsp; In that moment of mad happiness that
she should go out with him, go to a lecture with him&mdash;with him,
Martin Eden&mdash;she soared so far above him that there seemed nothing
else for him to do than die for her.&nbsp; It was the only fit way in
which he could express the tremendous and lofty emotion he felt for
her.&nbsp; It was the sublime abnegation of true love that comes to
all lovers, and it came to him there, at the telephone, in a whirlwind
of fire and glory; and to die for her, he felt, was to have lived and
loved well.&nbsp; And he was only twenty-one, and he had never been
in love before.</p>
<p>His hand trembled as he hung up the receiver, and he was weak from
the organ which had stirred him.&nbsp; His eyes were shining like an
angel&rsquo;s, and his face was transfigured, purged of all earthly
dross, and pure and holy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makin&rsquo; dates outside, eh?&rdquo; his brother-in-law
sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know what that means.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be
in the police court yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Martin could not come down from the height.&nbsp; Not even the
bestiality of the allusion could bring him back to earth.&nbsp; Anger
and hurt were beneath him.&nbsp; He had seen a great vision and was
as a god, and he could feel only profound and awful pity for this maggot
of a man.&nbsp; He did not look at him, and though his eyes passed over
him, he did not see him; and as in a dream he passed out of the room
to dress.&nbsp; It was not until he had reached his own room and was
tying his necktie that he became aware of a sound that lingered unpleasantly
in his ears.&nbsp; On investigating this sound he identified it as the
final snort of Bernard Higginbotham, which somehow had not penetrated
to his brain before.</p>
<p>As Ruth&rsquo;s front door closed behind them and he came down the
steps with her, he found himself greatly perturbed.&nbsp; It was not
unalloyed bliss, taking her to the lecture.&nbsp; He did not know what
he ought to do.&nbsp; He had seen, on the streets, with persons of her
class, that the women took the men&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; But then, again,
he had seen them when they didn&rsquo;t; and he wondered if it was only
in the evening that arms were taken, or only between husbands and wives
and relatives.</p>
<p>Just before he reached the sidewalk, he remembered Minnie.&nbsp;
Minnie had always been a stickler.&nbsp; She had called him down the
second time she walked out with him, because he had gone along on the
inside, and she had laid the law down to him that a gentleman always
walked on the outside&mdash;when he was with a lady.&nbsp; And Minnie
had made a practice of kicking his heels, whenever they crossed from
one side of the street to the other, to remind him to get over on the
outside.&nbsp; He wondered where she had got that item of etiquette,
and whether it had filtered down from above and was all right.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t do any harm to try it, he decided, by the time
they had reached the sidewalk; and he swung behind Ruth and took up
his station on the outside.&nbsp; Then the other problem presented itself.&nbsp;
Should he offer her his arm?&nbsp; He had never offered anybody his
arm in his life.&nbsp; The girls he had known never took the fellows&rsquo;
arms.&nbsp; For the first several times they walked freely, side by
side, and after that it was arms around the waists, and heads against
the fellows&rsquo; shoulders where the streets were unlighted.&nbsp;
But this was different.&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t that kind of a girl.&nbsp;
He must do something.</p>
<p>He crooked the arm next to her&mdash;crooked it very slightly and
with secret tentativeness, not invitingly, but just casually, as though
he was accustomed to walk that way.&nbsp; And then the wonderful thing
happened.&nbsp; He felt her hand upon his arm.&nbsp; Delicious thrills
ran through him at the contact, and for a few sweet moments it seemed
that he had left the solid earth and was flying with her through the
air.&nbsp; But he was soon back again, perturbed by a new complication.&nbsp;
They were crossing the street.&nbsp; This would put him on the inside.&nbsp;
He should be on the outside.&nbsp; Should he therefore drop her arm
and change over?&nbsp; And if he did so, would he have to repeat the
manoeuvre the next time?&nbsp; And the next?&nbsp; There was something
wrong about it, and he resolved not to caper about and play the fool.&nbsp;
Yet he was not satisfied with his conclusion, and when he found himself
on the inside, he talked quickly and earnestly, making a show of being
carried away by what he was saying, so that, in case he was wrong in
not changing sides, his enthusiasm would seem the cause for his carelessness.</p>
<p>As they crossed Broadway, he came face to face with a new problem.&nbsp;
In the blaze of the electric lights, he saw Lizzie Connolly and her
giggly friend.&nbsp; Only for an instant he hesitated, then his hand
went up and his hat came off.&nbsp; He could not be disloyal to his
kind, and it was to more than Lizzie Connolly that his hat was lifted.&nbsp;
She nodded and looked at him boldly, not with soft and gentle eyes like
Ruth&rsquo;s, but with eyes that were handsome and hard, and that swept
on past him to Ruth and itemized her face and dress and station.&nbsp;
And he was aware that Ruth looked, too, with quick eyes that were timid
and mild as a dove&rsquo;s, but which saw, in a look that was a flutter
on and past, the working-class girl in her cheap finery and under the
strange hat that all working-class girls were wearing just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pretty girl!&rdquo; Ruth said a moment later.</p>
<p>Martin could have blessed her, though he said:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I guess it&rsquo;s all a matter
of personal taste, but she doesn&rsquo;t strike me as being particularly
pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there isn&rsquo;t one woman in ten thousand with features
as regular as hers.&nbsp; They are splendid.&nbsp; Her face is as clear-cut
as a cameo.&nbsp; And her eyes are beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; Martin queried absently, for to him
there was only one beautiful woman in the world, and she was beside
him, her hand upon his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I think so?&nbsp; If that girl had proper opportunity to
dress, Mr. Eden, and if she were taught how to carry herself, you would
be fairly dazzled by her, and so would all men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would have to be taught how to speak,&rdquo; he commented,
&ldquo;or else most of the men wouldn&rsquo;t understand her.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure you couldn&rsquo;t understand a quarter of what she said
if she just spoke naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; You are as bad as Arthur when you try to make
your point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget how I talked when you first met me.&nbsp; I have
learned a new language since then.&nbsp; Before that time I talked as
that girl talks.&nbsp; Now I can manage to make myself understood sufficiently
in your language to explain that you do not know that other girl&rsquo;s
language.&nbsp; And do you know why she carries herself the way she
does?&nbsp; I think about such things now, though I never used to think
about them, and I am beginning to understand&mdash;much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why does she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has worked long hours for years at machines.&nbsp; When
one&rsquo;s body is young, it is very pliable, and hard work will mould
it like putty according to the nature of the work.&nbsp; I can tell
at a glance the trades of many workingmen I meet on the street.&nbsp;
Look at me.&nbsp; Why am I rolling all about the shop?&nbsp; Because
of the years I put in on the sea.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;d put in the same
years cow-punching, with my body young and pliable, I wouldn&rsquo;t
be rolling now, but I&rsquo;d be bow-legged.&nbsp; And so with that
girl.&nbsp; You noticed that her eyes were what I might call hard.&nbsp;
She has never been sheltered.&nbsp; She has had to take care of herself,
and a young girl can&rsquo;t take care of herself and keep her eyes
soft and gentle like&mdash;like yours, for example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are right,&rdquo; Ruth said in a low voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And it is too bad.&nbsp; She is such a pretty girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her and saw her eyes luminous with pity.&nbsp; And then
he remembered that he loved her and was lost in amazement at his fortune
that permitted him to love her and to take her on his arm to a lecture.</p>
<p>Who are you, Martin Eden? he demanded of himself in the looking-glass,
that night when he got back to his room.&nbsp; He gazed at himself long
and curiously.&nbsp; Who are you?&nbsp; What are you?&nbsp; Where do
you belong?&nbsp; You belong by rights to girls like Lizzie Connolly.&nbsp;
You belong with the legions of toil, with all that is low, and vulgar,
and unbeautiful.&nbsp; You belong with the oxen and the drudges, in
dirty surroundings among smells and stenches.&nbsp; There are the stale
vegetables now.&nbsp; Those potatoes are rotting.&nbsp; Smell them,
damn you, smell them.&nbsp; And yet you dare to open the books, to listen
to beautiful music, to learn to love beautiful paintings, to speak good
English, to think thoughts that none of your own kind thinks, to tear
yourself away from the oxen and the Lizzie Connollys and to love a pale
spirit of a woman who is a million miles beyond you and who lives in
the stars!&nbsp; Who are you? and what are you? damn you!&nbsp; And
are you going to make good?</p>
<p>He shook his fist at himself in the glass, and sat down on the edge
of the bed to dream for a space with wide eyes.&nbsp; Then he got out
note-book and algebra and lost himself in quadratic equations, while
the hours slipped by, and the stars dimmed, and the gray of dawn flooded
against his window.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>It was the knot of wordy socialists and working-class philosophers
that held forth in the City Hall Park on warm afternoons that was responsible
for the great discovery.&nbsp; Once or twice in the month, while riding
through the park on his way to the library, Martin dismounted from his
wheel and listened to the arguments, and each time he tore himself away
reluctantly.&nbsp; The tone of discussion was much lower than at Mr.
Morse&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; The men were not grave and dignified.&nbsp;
They lost their tempers easily and called one another names, while oaths
and obscene allusions were frequent on their lips.&nbsp; Once or twice
he had seen them come to blows.&nbsp; And yet, he knew not why, there
seemed something vital about the stuff of these men&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp;
Their logomachy was far more stimulating to his intellect than the reserved
and quiet dogmatism of Mr. Morse.&nbsp; These men, who slaughtered English,
gesticulated like lunatics, and fought one another&rsquo;s ideas with
primitive anger, seemed somehow to be more alive than Mr. Morse and
his crony, Mr. Butler.</p>
<p>Martin had heard Herbert Spencer quoted several times in the park,
but one afternoon a disciple of Spencer&rsquo;s appeared, a seedy tramp
with a dirty coat buttoned tightly at the throat to conceal the absence
of a shirt.&nbsp; Battle royal was waged, amid the smoking of many cigarettes
and the expectoration of much tobacco-juice, wherein the tramp successfully
held his own, even when a socialist workman sneered, &ldquo;There is
no god but the Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is his prophet.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Martin was puzzled as to what the discussion was about, but when he
rode on to the library he carried with him a new-born interest in Herbert
Spencer, and because of the frequency with which the tramp had mentioned
&ldquo;First Principles,&rdquo; Martin drew out that volume.</p>
<p>So the great discovery began.&nbsp; Once before he had tried Spencer,
and choosing the &ldquo;Principles of Psychology&rdquo; to begin with,
he had failed as abjectly as he had failed with Madam Blavatsky.&nbsp;
There had been no understanding the book, and he had returned it unread.&nbsp;
But this night, after algebra and physics, and an attempt at a sonnet,
he got into bed and opened &ldquo;First Principles.&rdquo;&nbsp; Morning
found him still reading.&nbsp; It was impossible for him to sleep.&nbsp;
Nor did he write that day.&nbsp; He lay on the bed till his body grew
tired, when he tried the hard floor, reading on his back, the book held
in the air above him, or changing from side to side.&nbsp; He slept
that night, and did his writing next morning, and then the book tempted
him and he fell, reading all afternoon, oblivious to everything and
oblivious to the fact that that was the afternoon Ruth gave to him.&nbsp;
His first consciousness of the immediate world about him was when Bernard
Higginbotham jerked open the door and demanded to know if he thought
they were running a restaurant.</p>
<p>Martin Eden had been mastered by curiosity all his days.&nbsp; He
wanted to know, and it was this desire that had sent him adventuring
over the world.&nbsp; But he was now learning from Spencer that he never
had known, and that he never could have known had he continued his sailing
and wandering forever.&nbsp; He had merely skimmed over the surface
of things, observing detached phenomena, accumulating fragments of facts,
making superficial little generalizations&mdash;and all and everything
quite unrelated in a capricious and disorderly world of whim and chance.&nbsp;
The mechanism of the flight of birds he had watched and reasoned about
with understanding; but it had never entered his head to try to explain
the process whereby birds, as organic flying mechanisms, had been developed.&nbsp;
He had never dreamed there was such a process.&nbsp; That birds should
have come to be, was unguessed.&nbsp; They always had been.&nbsp; They
just happened.</p>
<p>And as it was with birds, so had it been with everything.&nbsp; His
ignorant and unprepared attempts at philosophy had been fruitless.&nbsp;
The medieval metaphysics of Kant had given him the key to nothing, and
had served the sole purpose of making him doubt his own intellectual
powers.&nbsp; In similar manner his attempt to study evolution had been
confined to a hopelessly technical volume by Romanes.&nbsp; He had understood
nothing, and the only idea he had gathered was that evolution was a
dry-as-dust theory, of a lot of little men possessed of huge and unintelligible
vocabularies.&nbsp; And now he learned that evolution was no mere theory
but an accepted process of development; that scientists no longer disagreed
about it, their only differences being over the method of evolution.</p>
<p>And here was the man Spencer, organizing all knowledge for him, reducing
everything to unity, elaborating ultimate realities, and presenting
to his startled gaze a universe so concrete of realization that it was
like the model of a ship such as sailors make and put into glass bottles.&nbsp;
There was no caprice, no chance.&nbsp; All was law.&nbsp; It was in
obedience to law that the bird flew, and it was in obedience to the
same law that fermenting slime had writhed and squirmed and put out
legs and wings and become a bird.</p>
<p>Martin had ascended from pitch to pitch of intellectual living, and
here he was at a higher pitch than ever.&nbsp; All the hidden things
were laying their secrets bare.&nbsp; He was drunken with comprehension.&nbsp;
At night, asleep, he lived with the gods in colossal nightmare; and
awake, in the day, he went around like a somnambulist, with absent stare,
gazing upon the world he had just discovered.&nbsp; At table he failed
to hear the conversation about petty and ignoble things, his eager mind
seeking out and following cause and effect in everything before him.&nbsp;
In the meat on the platter he saw the shining sun and traced its energy
back through all its transformations to its source a hundred million
miles away, or traced its energy ahead to the moving muscles in his
arms that enabled him to cut the meat, and to the brain wherewith he
willed the muscles to move to cut the meat, until, with inward gaze,
he saw the same sun shining in his brain.&nbsp; He was entranced by
illumination, and did not hear the &ldquo;Bughouse,&rdquo; whispered
by Jim, nor see the anxiety on his sister&rsquo;s face, nor notice the
rotary motion of Bernard Higginbotham&rsquo;s finger, whereby he imparted
the suggestion of wheels revolving in his brother-in-law&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>What, in a way, most profoundly impressed Martin, was the correlation
of knowledge&mdash;of all knowledge.&nbsp; He had been curious to know
things, and whatever he acquired he had filed away in separate memory
compartments in his brain.&nbsp; Thus, on the subject of sailing he
had an immense store.&nbsp; On the subject of woman he had a fairly
large store.&nbsp; But these two subjects had been unrelated.&nbsp;
Between the two memory compartments there had been no connection.&nbsp;
That, in the fabric of knowledge, there should be any connection whatever
between a woman with hysterics and a schooner carrying a weather-helm
or heaving to in a gale, would have struck him as ridiculous and impossible.&nbsp;
But Herbert Spencer had shown him not only that it was not ridiculous,
but that it was impossible for there to be no connection.&nbsp; All
things were related to all other things from the farthermost star in
the wastes of space to the myriads of atoms in the grain of sand under
one&rsquo;s foot.&nbsp; This new concept was a perpetual amazement to
Martin, and he found himself engaged continually in tracing the relationship
between all things under the sun and on the other side of the sun.&nbsp;
He drew up lists of the most incongruous things and was unhappy until
he succeeded in establishing kinship between them all&mdash;kinship
between love, poetry, earthquake, fire, rattlesnakes, rainbows, precious
gems, monstrosities, sunsets, the roaring of lions, illuminating gas,
cannibalism, beauty, murder, lovers, fulcrums, and tobacco.&nbsp; Thus,
he unified the universe and held it up and looked at it, or wandered
through its byways and alleys and jungles, not as a terrified traveller
in the thick of mysteries seeking an unknown goal, but observing and
charting and becoming familiar with all there was to know.&nbsp; And
the more he knew, the more passionately he admired the universe, and
life, and his own life in the midst of it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; he cried at his image in the looking-glass.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You wanted to write, and you tried to write, and you had nothing
in you to write about.&nbsp; What did you have in you?&mdash;some childish
notions, a few half-baked sentiments, a lot of undigested beauty, a
great black mass of ignorance, a heart filled to bursting with love,
and an ambition as big as your love and as futile as your ignorance.&nbsp;
And you wanted to write!&nbsp; Why, you&rsquo;re just on the edge of
beginning to get something in you to write about.&nbsp; You wanted to
create beauty, but how could you when you knew nothing about the nature
of beauty?&nbsp; You wanted to write about life when you knew nothing
of the essential characteristics of life.&nbsp; You wanted to write
about the world and the scheme of existence when the world was a Chinese
puzzle to you and all that you could have written would have been about
what you did not know of the scheme of existence.&nbsp; But cheer up,
Martin, my boy.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll write yet.&nbsp; You know a little,
a very little, and you&rsquo;re on the right road now to know more.&nbsp;
Some day, if you&rsquo;re lucky, you may come pretty close to knowing
all that may be known.&nbsp; Then you will write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought his great discovery to Ruth, sharing with her all his
joy and wonder in it.&nbsp; But she did not seem to be so enthusiastic
over it.&nbsp; She tacitly accepted it and, in a way, seemed aware of
it from her own studies.&nbsp; It did not stir her deeply, as it did
him, and he would have been surprised had he not reasoned it out that
it was not new and fresh to her as it was to him.&nbsp; Arthur and Norman,
he found, believed in evolution and had read Spencer, though it did
not seem to have made any vital impression upon them, while the young
fellow with the glasses and the mop of hair, Will Olney, sneered disagreeably
at Spencer and repeated the epigram, &ldquo;There is no god but the
Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is his prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Martin forgave him the sneer, for he had begun to discover that
Olney was not in love with Ruth.&nbsp; Later, he was dumfounded to learn
from various little happenings not only that Olney did not care for
Ruth, but that he had a positive dislike for her.&nbsp; Martin could
not understand this.&nbsp; It was a bit of phenomena that he could not
correlate with all the rest of the phenomena in the universe.&nbsp;
But nevertheless he felt sorry for the young fellow because of the great
lack in his nature that prevented him from a proper appreciation of
Ruth&rsquo;s fineness and beauty.&nbsp; They rode out into the hills
several Sundays on their wheels, and Martin had ample opportunity to
observe the armed truce that existed between Ruth and Olney.&nbsp; The
latter chummed with Norman, throwing Arthur and Martin into company
with Ruth, for which Martin was duly grateful.</p>
<p>Those Sundays were great days for Martin, greatest because he was
with Ruth, and great, also, because they were putting him more on a
par with the young men of her class.&nbsp; In spite of their long years
of disciplined education, he was finding himself their intellectual
equal, and the hours spent with them in conversation was so much practice
for him in the use of the grammar he had studied so hard.&nbsp; He had
abandoned the etiquette books, falling back upon observation to show
him the right things to do.&nbsp; Except when carried away by his enthusiasm,
he was always on guard, keenly watchful of their actions and learning
their little courtesies and refinements of conduct.</p>
<p>The fact that Spencer was very little read was for some time a source
of surprise to Martin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Herbert Spencer,&rdquo; said the
man at the desk in the library, &ldquo;oh, yes, a great mind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But the man did not seem to know anything of the content of that great
mind.&nbsp; One evening, at dinner, when Mr. Butler was there, Martin
turned the conversation upon Spencer.&nbsp; Mr. Morse bitterly arraigned
the English philosopher&rsquo;s agnosticism, but confessed that he had
not read &ldquo;First Principles&rdquo;; while Mr. Butler stated that
he had no patience with Spencer, had never read a line of him, and had
managed to get along quite well without him.&nbsp; Doubts arose in Martin&rsquo;s
mind, and had he been less strongly individual he would have accepted
the general opinion and given Herbert Spencer up.&nbsp; As it was, he
found Spencer&rsquo;s explanation of things convincing; and, as he phrased
it to himself, to give up Spencer would be equivalent to a navigator
throwing the compass and chronometer overboard.&nbsp; So Martin went
on into a thorough study of evolution, mastering more and more the subject
himself, and being convinced by the corroborative testimony of a thousand
independent writers.&nbsp; The more he studied, the more vistas he caught
of fields of knowledge yet unexplored, and the regret that days were
only twenty-four hours long became a chronic complaint with him.</p>
<p>One day, because the days were so short, he decided to give up algebra
and geometry.&nbsp; Trigonometry he had not even attempted.&nbsp; Then
he cut chemistry from his study-list, retaining only physics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a specialist,&rdquo; he said, in defence, to Ruth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nor am I going to try to be a specialist.&nbsp; There are too
many special fields for any one man, in a whole lifetime, to master
a tithe of them.&nbsp; I must pursue general knowledge.&nbsp; When I
need the work of specialists, I shall refer to their books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is not like having the knowledge yourself,&rdquo;
she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is unnecessary to have it.&nbsp; We profit from the
work of the specialists.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what they are for.&nbsp;
When I came in, I noticed the chimney-sweeps at work.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
specialists, and when they get done, you will enjoy clean chimneys without
knowing anything about the construction of chimneys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s far-fetched, I am afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him curiously, and he felt a reproach in her gaze and
manner.&nbsp; But he was convinced of the rightness of his position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All thinkers on general subjects, the greatest minds in the
world, in fact, rely on the specialists.&nbsp; Herbert Spencer did that.&nbsp;
He generalized upon the findings of thousands of investigators.&nbsp;
He would have had to live a thousand lives in order to do it all himself.&nbsp;
And so with Darwin.&nbsp; He took advantage of all that had been learned
by the florists and cattle-breeders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Martin,&rdquo; Olney said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know what you&rsquo;re after, and Ruth doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t
know what she is after for herself even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Olney rushed on, heading off her objection,
&ldquo;I know you call it general culture.&nbsp; But it doesn&rsquo;t
matter what you study if you want general culture.&nbsp; You can study
French, or you can study German, or cut them both out and study Esperanto,
you&rsquo;ll get the culture tone just the same.&nbsp; You can study
Greek or Latin, too, for the same purpose, though it will never be any
use to you.&nbsp; It will be culture, though.&nbsp; Why, Ruth studied
Saxon, became clever in it,&mdash;that was two years ago,&mdash;and
all that she remembers of it now is &lsquo;Whan that sweet Aprile with
his schowers soote&rsquo;&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that the way it goes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s given you the culture tone just the same,&rdquo;
he laughed, again heading her off.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know.&nbsp; We were
in the same classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you speak of culture as if it should be a means to something,&rdquo;
Ruth cried out.&nbsp; Her eyes were flashing, and in her cheeks were
two spots of color.&nbsp; &ldquo;Culture is the end in itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is not what Martin wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, Martin?&rdquo; Olney demanded, turning squarely
upon him.</p>
<p>Martin felt very uncomfortable, and looked entreaty at Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what do you want?&rdquo; Ruth asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
will settle it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, I want culture,&rdquo; Martin faltered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I love beauty, and culture will give me a finer and keener appreciation
of beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head and looked triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rot, and you know it,&rdquo; was Olney&rsquo;s comment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Martin&rsquo;s after career, not culture.&nbsp; It just happens
that culture, in his case, is incidental to career.&nbsp; If he wanted
to be a chemist, culture would be unnecessary.&nbsp; Martin wants to
write, but he&rsquo;s afraid to say so because it will put you in the
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why does Martin want to write?&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because he isn&rsquo;t rolling in wealth.&nbsp; Why do you fill
your head with Saxon and general culture?&nbsp; Because you don&rsquo;t
have to make your way in the world.&nbsp; Your father sees to that.&nbsp;
He buys your clothes for you, and all the rest.&nbsp; What rotten good
is our education, yours and mine and Arthur&rsquo;s and Norman&rsquo;s?&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re soaked in general culture, and if our daddies went broke
to-day, we&rsquo;d be falling down to-morrow on teachers&rsquo; examinations.&nbsp;
The best job you could get, Ruth, would be a country school or music
teacher in a girls&rsquo; boarding-school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray what would you do?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a blessed thing.&nbsp; I could earn a dollar and a half
a day, common labor, and I might get in as instructor in Hanley&rsquo;s
cramming joint&mdash;I say might, mind you, and I might be chucked out
at the end of the week for sheer inability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin followed the discussion closely, and while he was convinced
that Olney was right, he resented the rather cavalier treatment he accorded
Ruth.&nbsp; A new conception of love formed in his mind as he listened.&nbsp;
Reason had nothing to do with love.&nbsp; It mattered not whether the
woman he loved reasoned correctly or incorrectly.&nbsp; Love was above
reason.&nbsp; If it just happened that she did not fully appreciate
his necessity for a career, that did not make her a bit less lovable.&nbsp;
She was all lovable, and what she thought had nothing to do with her
lovableness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he replied to a question from Olney
that broke in upon his train of thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was saying that I hoped you wouldn&rsquo;t be fool enough
to tackle Latin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Latin is more than culture,&rdquo; Ruth broke in.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is equipment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, are you going to tackle it?&rdquo; Olney persisted.</p>
<p>Martin was sore beset.&nbsp; He could see that Ruth was hanging eagerly
upon his answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I won&rsquo;t have time,&rdquo; he said finally.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to, but I won&rsquo;t have time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Martin&rsquo;s not seeking culture,&rdquo; Olney
exulted.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to get somewhere, to do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it&rsquo;s mental training.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s mind
discipline.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s what makes disciplined minds.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ruth looked expectantly at Martin, as if waiting for him to change his
judgment.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know, the foot-ball players have to train
before the big game.&nbsp; And that is what Latin does for the thinker.&nbsp;
It trains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rot and bosh!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what they told us when we
were kids.&nbsp; But there is one thing they didn&rsquo;t tell us then.&nbsp;
They let us find it out for ourselves afterwards.&rdquo;&nbsp; Olney
paused for effect, then added, &ldquo;And what they didn&rsquo;t tell
us was that every gentleman should have studied Latin, but that no gentleman
should know Latin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s unfair,&rdquo; Ruth cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
knew you were turning the conversation just in order to get off something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clever all right,&rdquo; was the retort, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s fair, too.&nbsp; The only men who know their Latin are the
apothecaries, the lawyers, and the Latin professors.&nbsp; And if Martin
wants to be one of them, I miss my guess.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s all
that got to do with Herbert Spencer anyway?&nbsp; Martin&rsquo;s just
discovered Spencer, and he&rsquo;s wild over him.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because
Spencer is taking him somewhere.&nbsp; Spencer couldn&rsquo;t take me
anywhere, nor you.&nbsp; We haven&rsquo;t got anywhere to go.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll get married some day, and I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do
but keep track of the lawyers and business agents who will take care
of the money my father&rsquo;s going to leave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Onley got up to go, but turned at the door and delivered a parting
shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave Martin alone, Ruth.&nbsp; He knows what&rsquo;s
best for himself.&nbsp; Look at what he&rsquo;s done already.&nbsp;
He makes me sick sometimes, sick and ashamed of myself.&nbsp; He knows
more now about the world, and life, and man&rsquo;s place, and all the
rest, than Arthur, or Norman, or I, or you, too, for that matter, and
in spite of all our Latin, and French, and Saxon, and culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Ruth is my teacher,&rdquo; Martin answered chivalrously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is responsible for what little I have learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats!&rdquo;&nbsp; Olney looked at Ruth, and his expression
was malicious.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be telling me next
that you read Spencer on her recommendation&mdash;only you didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
And she doesn&rsquo;t know anything more about Darwin and evolution
than I do about King Solomon&rsquo;s mines.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that
jawbreaker definition about something or other, of Spencer&rsquo;s,
that you sprang on us the other day&mdash;that indefinite, incoherent
homogeneity thing?&nbsp; Spring it on her, and see if she understands
a word of it.&nbsp; That isn&rsquo;t culture, you see.&nbsp; Well, tra
la, and if you tackle Latin, Martin, I won&rsquo;t have any respect
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all the while, interested in the discussion, Martin had been
aware of an irk in it as well.&nbsp; It was about studies and lessons,
dealing with the rudiments of knowledge, and the schoolboyish tone of
it conflicted with the big things that were stirring in him&mdash;with
the grip upon life that was even then crooking his fingers like eagle&rsquo;s
talons, with the cosmic thrills that made him ache, and with the inchoate
consciousness of mastery of it all.&nbsp; He likened himself to a poet,
wrecked on the shores of a strange land, filled with power of beauty,
stumbling and stammering and vainly trying to sing in the rough, barbaric
tongue of his brethren in the new land.&nbsp; And so with him.&nbsp;
He was alive, painfully alive, to the great universal things, and yet
he was compelled to potter and grope among schoolboy topics and debate
whether or not he should study Latin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in hell has Latin to do with it?&rdquo; he demanded before
his mirror that night.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish dead people would stay dead.&nbsp;
Why should I and the beauty in me be ruled by the dead?&nbsp; Beauty
is alive and everlasting.&nbsp; Languages come and go.&nbsp; They are
the dust of the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And his next thought was that he had been phrasing his ideas very
well, and he went to bed wondering why he could not talk in similar
fashion when he was with Ruth.&nbsp; He was only a schoolboy, with a
schoolboy&rsquo;s tongue, when he was in her presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me time,&rdquo; he said aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only give
me time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time!&nbsp; Time!&nbsp; Time! was his unending plaint.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>It was not because of Olney, but in spite of Ruth, and his love for
Ruth, that he finally decided not to take up Latin.&nbsp; His money
meant time.&nbsp; There was so much that was more important than Latin,
so many studies that clamored with imperious voices.&nbsp; And he must
write.&nbsp; He must earn money.&nbsp; He had had no acceptances.&nbsp;
Twoscore of manuscripts were travelling the endless round of the magazines.&nbsp;
How did the others do it?&nbsp; He spent long hours in the free reading-room,
going over what others had written, studying their work eagerly and
critically, comparing it with his own, and wondering, wondering, about
the secret trick they had discovered which enabled them to sell their
work.</p>
<p>He was amazed at the immense amount of printed stuff that was dead.&nbsp;
No light, no life, no color, was shot through it.&nbsp; There was no
breath of life in it, and yet it sold, at two cents a word, twenty dollars
a thousand&mdash;the newspaper clipping had said so.&nbsp; He was puzzled
by countless short stories, written lightly and cleverly he confessed,
but without vitality or reality.&nbsp; Life was so strange and wonderful,
filled with an immensity of problems, of dreams, and of heroic toils,
and yet these stories dealt only with the commonplaces of life.&nbsp;
He felt the stress and strain of life, its fevers and sweats and wild
insurgences&mdash;surely this was the stuff to write about!&nbsp; He
wanted to glorify the leaders of forlorn hopes, the mad lovers, the
giants that fought under stress and strain, amid terror and tragedy,
making life crackle with the strength of their endeavor.&nbsp; And yet
the magazine short stories seemed intent on glorifying the Mr. Butlers,
the sordid dollar-chasers, and the commonplace little love affairs of
commonplace little men and women.&nbsp; Was it because the editors of
the magazines were commonplace? he demanded.&nbsp; Or were they afraid
of life, these writers and editors and readers?</p>
<p>But his chief trouble was that he did not know any editors or writers.&nbsp;
And not merely did he not know any writers, but he did not know anybody
who had ever attempted to write.&nbsp; There was nobody to tell him,
to hint to him, to give him the least word of advice.&nbsp; He began
to doubt that editors were real men.&nbsp; They seemed cogs in a machine.&nbsp;
That was what it was, a machine.&nbsp; He poured his soul into stories,
articles, and poems, and intrusted them to the machine.&nbsp; He folded
them just so, put the proper stamps inside the long envelope along with
the manuscript, sealed the envelope, put more stamps outside, and dropped
it into the mail-box.&nbsp; It travelled across the continent, and after
a certain lapse of time the postman returned him the manuscript in another
long envelope, on the outside of which were the stamps he had enclosed.&nbsp;
There was no human editor at the other end, but a mere cunning arrangement
of cogs that changed the manuscript from one envelope to another and
stuck on the stamps.&nbsp; It was like the slot machines wherein one
dropped pennies, and, with a metallic whirl of machinery had delivered
to him a stick of chewing-gum or a tablet of chocolate.&nbsp; It depended
upon which slot one dropped the penny in, whether he got chocolate or
gum.&nbsp; And so with the editorial machine.&nbsp; One slot brought
checks and the other brought rejection slips.&nbsp; So far he had found
only the latter slot.</p>
<p>It was the rejection slips that completed the horrible machinelikeness
of the process.&nbsp; These slips were printed in stereotyped forms
and he had received hundreds of them&mdash;as many as a dozen or more
on each of his earlier manuscripts.&nbsp; If he had received one line,
one personal line, along with one rejection of all his rejections, he
would have been cheered.&nbsp; But not one editor had given that proof
of existence.&nbsp; And he could conclude only that there were no warm
human men at the other end, only mere cogs, well oiled and running beautifully
in the machine.</p>
<p>He was a good fighter, whole-souled and stubborn, and he would have
been content to continue feeding the machine for years; but he was bleeding
to death, and not years but weeks would determine the fight.&nbsp; Each
week his board bill brought him nearer destruction, while the postage
on forty manuscripts bled him almost as severely.&nbsp; He no longer
bought books, and he economized in petty ways and sought to delay the
inevitable end; though he did not know how to economize, and brought
the end nearer by a week when he gave his sister Marian five dollars
for a dress.</p>
<p>He struggled in the dark, without advice, without encouragement,
and in the teeth of discouragement.&nbsp; Even Gertrude was beginning
to look askance.&nbsp; At first she had tolerated with sisterly fondness
what she conceived to be his foolishness; but now, out of sisterly solicitude,
she grew anxious.&nbsp; To her it seemed that his foolishness was becoming
a madness.&nbsp; Martin knew this and suffered more keenly from it than
from the open and nagging contempt of Bernard Higginbotham.&nbsp; Martin
had faith in himself, but he was alone in this faith.&nbsp; Not even
Ruth had faith.&nbsp; She had wanted him to devote himself to study,
and, though she had not openly disapproved of his writing, she had never
approved.</p>
<p>He had never offered to show her his work.&nbsp; A fastidious delicacy
had prevented him.&nbsp; Besides, she had been studying heavily at the
university, and he felt averse to robbing her of her time.&nbsp; But
when she had taken her degree, she asked him herself to let her see
something of what he had been doing.&nbsp; Martin was elated and diffident.&nbsp;
Here was a judge.&nbsp; She was a bachelor of arts.&nbsp; She had studied
literature under skilled instructors.&nbsp; Perhaps the editors were
capable judges, too.&nbsp; But she would be different from them.&nbsp;
She would not hand him a stereotyped rejection slip, nor would she inform
him that lack of preference for his work did not necessarily imply lack
of merit in his work.&nbsp; She would talk, a warm human being, in her
quick, bright way, and, most important of all, she would catch glimpses
of the real Martin Eden.&nbsp; In his work she would discern what his
heart and soul were like, and she would come to understand something,
a little something, of the stuff of his dreams and the strength of his
power.</p>
<p>Martin gathered together a number of carbon copies of his short stories,
hesitated a moment, then added his &ldquo;Sea Lyrics.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
mounted their wheels on a late June afternoon and rode for the hills.&nbsp;
It was the second time he had been out with her alone, and as they rode
along through the balmy warmth, just chilled by she sea-breeze to refreshing
coolness, he was profoundly impressed by the fact that it was a very
beautiful and well-ordered world and that it was good to be alive and
to love.&nbsp; They left their wheels by the roadside and climbed to
the brown top of an open knoll where the sunburnt grass breathed a harvest
breath of dry sweetness and content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its work is done,&rdquo; Martin said, as they seated themselves,
she upon his coat, and he sprawling close to the warm earth.&nbsp; He
sniffed the sweetness of the tawny grass, which entered his brain and
set his thoughts whirling on from the particular to the universal.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It has achieved its reason for existence,&rdquo; he went on,
patting the dry grass affectionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;It quickened with
ambition under the dreary downpour of last winter, fought the violent
early spring, flowered, and lured the insects and the bees, scattered
its seeds, squared itself with its duty and the world, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you always look at things with such dreadfully practical
eyes?&rdquo; she interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve been studying evolution, I guess.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s only recently that I got my eyesight, if the truth were told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it seems to me you lose sight of beauty by being so practical,
that you destroy beauty like the boys who catch butterflies and rub
the down off their beautiful wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beauty has significance, but I never knew its significance
before.&nbsp; I just accepted beauty as something meaningless, as something
that was just beautiful without rhyme or reason.&nbsp; I did not know
anything about beauty.&nbsp; But now I know, or, rather, am just beginning
to know.&nbsp; This grass is more beautiful to me now that I know why
it is grass, and all the hidden chemistry of sun and rain and earth
that makes it become grass.&nbsp; Why, there is romance in the life-history
of any grass, yes, and adventure, too.&nbsp; The very thought of it
stirs me.&nbsp; When I think of the play of force and matter, and all
the tremendous struggle of it, I feel as if I could write an epic on
the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How well you talk,&rdquo; she said absently, and he noted
that she was looking at him in a searching way.</p>
<p>He was all confusion and embarrassment on the instant, the blood
flushing red on his neck and brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I am learning to talk,&rdquo; he stammered.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
seems to be so much in me I want to say.&nbsp; But it is all so big.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t find ways to say what is really in me.&nbsp; Sometimes
it seems to me that all the world, all life, everything, had taken up
residence inside of me and was clamoring for me to be the spokesman.&nbsp;
I feel&mdash;oh, I can&rsquo;t describe it&mdash;I feel the bigness
of it, but when I speak, I babble like a little child.&nbsp; It is a
great task to transmute feeling and sensation into speech, written or
spoken, that will, in turn, in him who reads or listens, transmute itself
back into the selfsame feeling and sensation.&nbsp; It is a lordly task.&nbsp;
See, I bury my face in the grass, and the breath I draw in through my
nostrils sets me quivering with a thousand thoughts and fancies.&nbsp;
It is a breath of the universe I have breathed.&nbsp; I know song and
laughter, and success and pain, and struggle and death; and I see visions
that arise in my brain somehow out of the scent of the grass, and I
would like to tell them to you, to the world.&nbsp; But how can I?&nbsp;
My tongue is tied.&nbsp; I have tried, by the spoken word, just now,
to describe to you the effect on me of the scent of the grass.&nbsp;
But I have not succeeded.&nbsp; I have no more than hinted in awkward
speech.&nbsp; My words seem gibberish to me.&nbsp; And yet I am stifled
with desire to tell.&nbsp; Oh!&mdash;&rdquo; he threw up his hands with
a despairing gesture&mdash;&ldquo;it is impossible!&nbsp; It is not
understandable!&nbsp; It is incommunicable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you do talk well,&rdquo; she insisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just
think how you have improved in the short time I have known you.&nbsp;
Mr. Butler is a noted public speaker.&nbsp; He is always asked by the
State Committee to go out on stump during campaign.&nbsp; Yet you talked
just as well as he the other night at dinner.&nbsp; Only he was more
controlled.&nbsp; You get too excited; but you will get over that with
practice.&nbsp; Why, you would make a good public speaker.&nbsp; You
can go far&mdash;if you want to.&nbsp; You are masterly.&nbsp; You can
lead men, I am sure, and there is no reason why you should not succeed
at anything you set your hand to, just as you have succeeded with grammar.&nbsp;
You would make a good lawyer.&nbsp; You should shine in politics.&nbsp;
There is nothing to prevent you from making as great a success as Mr.
Butler has made.&nbsp; And minus the dyspepsia,&rdquo; she added with
a smile.</p>
<p>They talked on; she, in her gently persistent way, returning always
to the need of thorough grounding in education and to the advantages
of Latin as part of the foundation for any career.&nbsp; She drew her
ideal of the successful man, and it was largely in her father&rsquo;s
image, with a few unmistakable lines and touches of color from the image
of Mr. Butler.&nbsp; He listened eagerly, with receptive ears, lying
on his back and looking up and joying in each movement of her lips as
she talked.&nbsp; But his brain was not receptive.&nbsp; There was nothing
alluring in the pictures she drew, and he was aware of a dull pain of
disappointment and of a sharper ache of love for her.&nbsp; In all she
said there was no mention of his writing, and the manuscripts he had
brought to read lay neglected on the ground.</p>
<p>At last, in a pause, he glanced at the sun, measured its height above
the horizon, and suggested his manuscripts by picking them up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had forgotten,&rdquo; she said quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
I am so anxious to hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He read to her a story, one that he flattered himself was among his
very best.&nbsp; He called it &ldquo;The Wine of Life,&rdquo; and the
wine of it, that had stolen into his brain when he wrote it, stole into
his brain now as he read it.&nbsp; There was a certain magic in the
original conception, and he had adorned it with more magic of phrase
and touch.&nbsp; All the old fire and passion with which he had written
it were reborn in him, and he was swayed and swept away so that he was
blind and deaf to the faults of it.&nbsp; But it was not so with Ruth.&nbsp;
Her trained ear detected the weaknesses and exaggerations, the overemphasis
of the tyro, and she was instantly aware each time the sentence-rhythm
tripped and faltered.&nbsp; She scarcely noted the rhythm otherwise,
except when it became too pompous, at which moments she was disagreeably
impressed with its amateurishness.&nbsp; That was her final judgment
on the story as a whole&mdash;amateurish, though she did not tell him
so.&nbsp; Instead, when he had done, she pointed out the minor flaws
and said that she liked the story.</p>
<p>But he was disappointed.&nbsp; Her criticism was just.&nbsp; He acknowledged
that, but he had a feeling that he was not sharing his work with her
for the purpose of schoolroom correction.&nbsp; The details did not
matter.&nbsp; They could take care of themselves.&nbsp; He could mend
them, he could learn to mend them.&nbsp; Out of life he had captured
something big and attempted to imprison it in the story.&nbsp; It was
the big thing out of life he had read to her, not sentence-structure
and semicolons.&nbsp; He wanted her to feel with him this big thing
that was his, that he had seen with his own eyes, grappled with his
own brain, and placed there on the page with his own hands in printed
words.&nbsp; Well, he had failed, was his secret decision.&nbsp; Perhaps
the editors were right.&nbsp; He had felt the big thing, but he had
failed to transmute it.&nbsp; He concealed his disappointment, and joined
so easily with her in her criticism that she did not realize that deep
down in him was running a strong undercurrent of disagreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This next thing I&rsquo;ve called &lsquo;The Pot&rsquo;,&rdquo;
he said, unfolding the manuscript.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has been refused
by four or five magazines now, but still I think it is good.&nbsp; In
fact, I don&rsquo;t know what to think of it, except that I&rsquo;ve
caught something there.&nbsp; Maybe it won&rsquo;t affect you as it
does me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a short thing&mdash;only two thousand words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; she cried, when he had finished.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is horrible, unutterably horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He noted her pale face, her eyes wide and tense, and her clenched
hands, with secret satisfaction.&nbsp; He had succeeded.&nbsp; He had
communicated the stuff of fancy and feeling from out of his brain.&nbsp;
It had struck home.&nbsp; No matter whether she liked it or not, it
had gripped her and mastered her, made her sit there and listen and
forget details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is life,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and life is not always
beautiful.&nbsp; And yet, perhaps because I am strangely made, I find
something beautiful there.&nbsp; It seems to me that the beauty is tenfold
enhanced because it is there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why couldn&rsquo;t the poor woman&mdash;&rdquo; she broke
in disconnectedly.&nbsp; Then she left the revolt of her thought unexpressed
to cry out: &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; It is degrading!&nbsp; It is not nice!&nbsp;
It is nasty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the moment it seemed to him that his heart stood still.&nbsp;
<i>Nasty</i>!&nbsp; He had never dreamed it.&nbsp; He had not meant
it.&nbsp; The whole sketch stood before him in letters of fire, and
in such blaze of illumination he sought vainly for nastiness.&nbsp;
Then his heart began to beat again.&nbsp; He was not guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you select a nice subject?&rdquo; she was
saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;We know there are nasty things in the world, but
that is no reason&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She talked on in her indignant strain, but he was not following her.&nbsp;
He was smiling to himself as he looked up into her virginal face, so
innocent, so penetratingly innocent, that its purity seemed always to
enter into him, driving out of him all dross and bathing him in some
ethereal effulgence that was as cool and soft and velvety as starshine.&nbsp;
<i>We know there are nasty things in the world</i>!&nbsp; He cuddled
to him the notion of her knowing, and chuckled over it as a love joke.&nbsp;
The next moment, in a flashing vision of multitudinous detail, he sighted
the whole sea of life&rsquo;s nastiness that he had known and voyaged
over and through, and he forgave her for not understanding the story.&nbsp;
It was through no fault of hers that she could not understand.&nbsp;
He thanked God that she had been born and sheltered to such innocence.&nbsp;
But he knew life, its foulness as well as its fairness, its greatness
in spite of the slime that infested it, and by God he was going to have
his say on it to the world.&nbsp; Saints in heaven&mdash;how could they
be anything but fair and pure?&nbsp; No praise to them.&nbsp; But saints
in slime&mdash;ah, that was the everlasting wonder!&nbsp; That was what
made life worth while.&nbsp; To see moral grandeur rising out of cesspools
of iniquity; to rise himself and first glimpse beauty, faint and far,
through mud-dripping eyes; to see out of weakness, and frailty, and
viciousness, and all abysmal brutishness, arising strength, and truth,
and high spiritual endowment&mdash;</p>
<p>He caught a stray sequence of sentences she was uttering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tone of it all is low.&nbsp; And there is so much that
is high.&nbsp; Take &lsquo;In Memoriam.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was impelled to suggest &ldquo;Locksley Hall,&rdquo; and would
have done so, had not his vision gripped him again and left him staring
at her, the female of his kind, who, out of the primordial ferment,
creeping and crawling up the vast ladder of life for a thousand thousand
centuries, had emerged on the topmost rung, having become one Ruth,
pure, and fair, and divine, and with power to make him know love, and
to aspire toward purity, and to desire to taste divinity&mdash;him,
Martin Eden, who, too, had come up in some amazing fashion from out
of the ruck and the mire and the countless mistakes and abortions of
unending creation.&nbsp; There was the romance, and the wonder, and
the glory.&nbsp; There was the stuff to write, if he could only find
speech.&nbsp; Saints in heaven!&mdash;They were only saints and could
not help themselves.&nbsp; But he was a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have strength,&rdquo; he could hear her saying, &ldquo;but
it is untutored strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a bull in a china shop,&rdquo; he suggested, and won
a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you must develop discrimination.&nbsp; You must consult
taste, and fineness, and tone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare too much,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>She smiled approbation, and settled herself to listen to another
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ll make of this,&rdquo;
he said apologetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m afraid I got beyond my depth in it, but my intentions were
good.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t bother about the little features of it.&nbsp;
Just see if you catch the feel of the big thing in it.&nbsp; It is big,
and it is true, though the chance is large that I have failed to make
it intelligible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He read, and as he read he watched her.&nbsp; At last he had reached
her, he thought.&nbsp; She sat without movement, her eyes steadfast
upon him, scarcely breathing, caught up and out of herself, he thought,
by the witchery of the thing he had created.&nbsp; He had entitled the
story &ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo; and it was the apotheosis of adventure&mdash;not
of the adventure of the storybooks, but of real adventure, the savage
taskmaster, awful of punishment and awful of reward, faithless and whimsical,
demanding terrible patience and heartbreaking days and nights of toil,
offering the blazing sunlight glory or dark death at the end of thirst
and famine or of the long drag and monstrous delirium of rotting fever,
through blood and sweat and stinging insects leading up by long chains
of petty and ignoble contacts to royal culminations and lordly achievements.</p>
<p>It was this, all of it, and more, that he had put into his story,
and it was this, he believed, that warmed her as she sat and listened.&nbsp;
Her eyes were wide, color was in her pale cheeks, and before he finished
it seemed to him that she was almost panting.&nbsp; Truly, she was warmed;
but she was warmed, not by the story, but by him.&nbsp; She did not
think much of the story; it was Martin&rsquo;s intensity of power, the
old excess of strength that seemed to pour from his body and on and
over her.&nbsp; The paradox of it was that it was the story itself that
was freighted with his power, that was the channel, for the time being,
through which his strength poured out to her.&nbsp; She was aware only
of the strength, and not of the medium, and when she seemed most carried
away by what he had written, in reality she had been carried away by
something quite foreign to it&mdash;by a thought, terrible and perilous,
that had formed itself unsummoned in her brain.&nbsp; She had caught
herself wondering what marriage was like, and the becoming conscious
of the waywardness and ardor of the thought had terrified her.&nbsp;
It was unmaidenly.&nbsp; It was not like her.&nbsp; She had never been
tormented by womanhood, and she had lived in a dreamland of Tennysonian
poesy, dense even to the full significance of that delicate master&rsquo;s
delicate allusions to the grossnesses that intrude upon the relations
of queens and knights.&nbsp; She had been asleep, always, and now life
was thundering imperatively at all her doors.&nbsp; Mentally she was
in a panic to shoot the bolts and drop the bars into place, while wanton
instincts urged her to throw wide her portals and bid the deliciously
strange visitor to enter in.</p>
<p>Martin waited with satisfaction for her verdict.&nbsp; He had no
doubt of what it would be, and he was astounded when he heard her say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful,&rdquo; she repeated, with emphasis, after
a pause.</p>
<p>Of course it was beautiful; but there was something more than mere
beauty in it, something more stingingly splendid which had made beauty
its handmaiden.&nbsp; He sprawled silently on the ground, watching the
grisly form of a great doubt rising before him.&nbsp; He had failed.&nbsp;
He was inarticulate.&nbsp; He had seen one of the greatest things in
the world, and he had not expressed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think of the&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He hesitated,
abashed at his first attempt to use a strange word.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
the <i>motif</i>?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was confused,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is
my only criticism in the large way.&nbsp; I followed the story, but
there seemed so much else.&nbsp; It is too wordy.&nbsp; You clog the
action by introducing so much extraneous material.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the major <i>motif</i>,&rdquo; he hurriedly explained,
&ldquo;the big underrunning <i>motif</i>, the cosmic and universal thing.&nbsp;
I tried to make it keep time with the story itself, which was only superficial
after all.&nbsp; I was on the right scent, but I guess I did it badly.&nbsp;
I did not succeed in suggesting what I was driving at.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll
learn in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not follow him.&nbsp; She was a bachelor of arts, but he
had gone beyond her limitations.&nbsp; This she did not comprehend,
attributing her incomprehension to his incoherence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were too voluble,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it
was beautiful, in places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard her voice as from far off, for he was debating whether he
would read her the &ldquo;Sea Lyrics.&rdquo;&nbsp; He lay in dull despair,
while she watched him searchingly, pondering again upon unsummoned and
wayward thoughts of marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to be famous?&rdquo; she asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little bit,&rdquo; he confessed.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
is part of the adventure.&nbsp; It is not the being famous, but the
process of becoming so, that counts.&nbsp; And after all, to be famous
would be, for me, only a means to something else.&nbsp; I want to be
famous very much, for that matter, and for that reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For your sake,&rdquo; he wanted to add, and might have added
had she proved enthusiastic over what he had read to her.</p>
<p>But she was too busy in her mind, carving out a career for him that
would at least be possible, to ask what the ultimate something was which
he had hinted at.&nbsp; There was no career for him in literature.&nbsp;
Of that she was convinced.&nbsp; He had proved it to-day, with his amateurish
and sophomoric productions.&nbsp; He could talk well, but he was incapable
of expressing himself in a literary way.&nbsp; She compared Tennyson,
and Browning, and her favorite prose masters with him, and to his hopeless
discredit.&nbsp; Yet she did not tell him her whole mind.&nbsp; Her
strange interest in him led her to temporize.&nbsp; His desire to write
was, after all, a little weakness which he would grow out of in time.&nbsp;
Then he would devote himself to the more serious affairs of life.&nbsp;
And he would succeed, too.&nbsp; She knew that.&nbsp; He was so strong
that he could not fail&mdash;if only he would drop writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would show me all you write, Mr. Eden,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>He flushed with pleasure.&nbsp; She was interested, that much was
sure.&nbsp; And at least she had not given him a rejection slip.&nbsp;
She had called certain portions of his work beautiful, and that was
the first encouragement he had ever received from any one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he said passionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I promise
you, Miss Morse, that I will make good.&nbsp; I have come far, I know
that; and I have far to go, and I will cover it if I have to do it on
my hands and knees.&rdquo;&nbsp; He held up a bunch of manuscript.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here are the &lsquo;Sea Lyrics.&rsquo;&nbsp; When you get home,
I&rsquo;ll turn them over to you to read at your leisure.&nbsp; And
you must be sure to tell me just what you think of them.&nbsp; What
I need, you know, above all things, is criticism.&nbsp; And do, please,
be frank with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be perfectly frank,&rdquo; she promised, with an uneasy
conviction that she had not been frank with him and with a doubt if
she could be quite frank with him the next time.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The first battle, fought and finished,&rdquo; Martin said
to the looking-glass ten days later.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there will be
a second battle, and a third battle, and battles to the end of time,
unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not finished the sentence, but looked about the mean little
room and let his eyes dwell sadly upon a heap of returned manuscripts,
still in their long envelopes, which lay in a corner on the floor.&nbsp;
He had no stamps with which to continue them on their travels, and for
a week they had been piling up.&nbsp; More of them would come in on
the morrow, and on the next day, and the next, till they were all in.&nbsp;
And he would be unable to start them out again.&nbsp; He was a month&rsquo;s
rent behind on the typewriter, which he could not pay, having barely
enough for the week&rsquo;s board which was due and for the employment
office fees.</p>
<p>He sat down and regarded the table thoughtfully.&nbsp; There were
ink stains upon it, and he suddenly discovered that he was fond of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old table,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent some
happy hours with you, and you&rsquo;ve been a pretty good friend when
all is said and done.&nbsp; You never turned me down, never passed me
out a reward-of-unmerit rejection slip, never complained about working
overtime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dropped his arms upon the table and buried his face in them.&nbsp;
His throat was aching, and he wanted to cry.&nbsp; It reminded him of
his first fight, when he was six years old, when he punched away with
the tears running down his cheeks while the other boy, two years his
elder, had beaten and pounded him into exhaustion.&nbsp; He saw the
ring of boys, howling like barbarians as he went down at last, writhing
in the throes of nausea, the blood streaming from his nose and the tears
from his bruised eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little shaver,&rdquo; he murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re
just as badly licked now.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re beaten to a pulp.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re down and out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the vision of that first fight still lingered under his eyelids,
and as he watched he saw it dissolve and reshape into the series of
fights which had followed.&nbsp; Six months later Cheese-Face (that
was the boy) had whipped him again.&nbsp; But he had blacked Cheese-Face&rsquo;s
eye that time.&nbsp; That was going some.&nbsp; He saw them all, fight
after fight, himself always whipped and Cheese-Face exulting over him.&nbsp;
But he had never run away.&nbsp; He felt strengthened by the memory
of that.&nbsp; He had always stayed and taken his medicine.&nbsp; Cheese-Face
had been a little fiend at fighting, and had never once shown mercy
to him.&nbsp; But he had stayed!&nbsp; He had stayed with it!</p>
<p>Next, he saw a narrow alley, between ramshackle frame buildings.&nbsp;
The end of the alley was blocked by a one-story brick building, out
of which issued the rhythmic thunder of the presses, running off the
first edition of the <i>Enquirer</i>.&nbsp; He was eleven, and Cheese-Face
was thirteen, and they both carried the <i>Enquirer</i>.&nbsp; That
was why they were there, waiting for their papers.&nbsp; And, of course,
Cheese-Face had picked on him again, and there was another fight that
was indeterminate, because at quarter to four the door of the press-room
was thrown open and the gang of boys crowded in to fold their papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lick you to-morrow,&rdquo; he heard Cheese-Face
promise; and he heard his own voice, piping and trembling with unshed
tears, agreeing to be there on the morrow.</p>
<p>And he had come there the next day, hurrying from school to be there
first, and beating Cheese-Face by two minutes.&nbsp; The other boys
said he was all right, and gave him advice, pointing out his faults
as a scrapper and promising him victory if he carried out their instructions.&nbsp;
The same boys gave Cheese-Face advice, too.&nbsp; How they had enjoyed
the fight!&nbsp; He paused in his recollections long enough to envy
them the spectacle he and Cheese-Face had put up.&nbsp; Then the fight
was on, and it went on, without rounds, for thirty minutes, until the
press-room door was opened.</p>
<p>He watched the youthful apparition of himself, day after day, hurrying
from school to the <i>Enquirer</i> alley.&nbsp; He could not walk very
fast.&nbsp; He was stiff and lame from the incessant fighting.&nbsp;
His forearms were black and blue from wrist to elbow, what of the countless
blows he had warded off, and here and there the tortured flesh was beginning
to fester.&nbsp; His head and arms and shoulders ached, the small of
his back ached,&mdash;he ached all over, and his brain was heavy and
dazed.&nbsp; He did not play at school.&nbsp; Nor did he study.&nbsp;
Even to sit still all day at his desk, as he did, was a torment.&nbsp;
It seemed centuries since he had begun the round of daily fights, and
time stretched away into a nightmare and infinite future of daily fights.&nbsp;
Why couldn&rsquo;t Cheese-Face be licked? he often thought; that would
put him, Martin, out of his misery.&nbsp; It never entered his head
to cease fighting, to allow Cheese-Face to whip him.</p>
<p>And so he dragged himself to the <i>Enquirer</i> alley, sick in body
and soul, but learning the long patience, to confront his eternal enemy,
Cheese-Face, who was just as sick as he, and just a bit willing to quit
if it were not for the gang of newsboys that looked on and made pride
painful and necessary.&nbsp; One afternoon, after twenty minutes of
desperate efforts to annihilate each other according to set rules that
did not permit kicking, striking below the belt, nor hitting when one
was down, Cheese-Face, panting for breath and reeling, offered to call
it quits.&nbsp; And Martin, head on arms, thrilled at the picture he
caught of himself, at that moment in the afternoon of long ago, when
he reeled and panted and choked with the blood that ran into his mouth
and down his throat from his cut lips; when he tottered toward Cheese-Face,
spitting out a mouthful of blood so that he could speak, crying out
that he would never quit, though Cheese-Face could give in if he wanted
to.&nbsp; And Cheese-Face did not give in, and the fight went on.</p>
<p>The next day and the next, days without end, witnessed the afternoon
fight.&nbsp; When he put up his arms, each day, to begin, they pained
exquisitely, and the first few blows, struck and received, racked his
soul; after that things grew numb, and he fought on blindly, seeing
as in a dream, dancing and wavering, the large features and burning,
animal-like eyes of Cheese-Face.&nbsp; He concentrated upon that face;
all else about him was a whirling void.&nbsp; There was nothing else
in the world but that face, and he would never know rest, blessed rest,
until he had beaten that face into a pulp with his bleeding knuckles,
or until the bleeding knuckles that somehow belonged to that face had
beaten him into a pulp.&nbsp; And then, one way or the other, he would
have rest.&nbsp; But to quit,&mdash;for him, Martin, to quit,&mdash;that
was impossible!</p>
<p>Came the day when he dragged himself into the <i>Enquirer</i> alley,
and there was no Cheese-Face.&nbsp; Nor did Cheese-Face come.&nbsp;
The boys congratulated him, and told him that he had licked Cheese-Face.&nbsp;
But Martin was not satisfied.&nbsp; He had not licked Cheese-Face, nor
had Cheese-Face licked him.&nbsp; The problem had not been solved.&nbsp;
It was not until afterward that they learned that Cheese-Face&rsquo;s
father had died suddenly that very day.</p>
<p>Martin skipped on through the years to the night in the nigger heaven
at the Auditorium.&nbsp; He was seventeen and just back from sea.&nbsp;
A row started.&nbsp; Somebody was bullying somebody, and Martin interfered,
to be confronted by Cheese-Face&rsquo;s blazing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you after de show,&rdquo; his ancient enemy
hissed.</p>
<p>Martin nodded.&nbsp; The nigger-heaven bouncer was making his way
toward the disturbance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you outside, after the last act,&rdquo; Martin
whispered, the while his face showed undivided interest in the buck-and-wing
dancing on the stage.</p>
<p>The bouncer glared and went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a gang?&rdquo; he asked Cheese-Face, at the end of the
act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I got to get one,&rdquo; Martin announced.</p>
<p>Between the acts he mustered his following&mdash;three fellows he
knew from the nail works, a railroad fireman, and half a dozen of the
Boo Gang, along with as many more from the dread Eighteen-and-Market
Gang.</p>
<p>When the theatre let out, the two gangs strung along inconspicuously
on opposite sides of the street.&nbsp; When they came to a quiet corner,
they united and held a council of war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighth Street Bridge is the place,&rdquo; said a red-headed
fellow belonging to Cheese-Face&rsquo;s Gang.&nbsp; &ldquo;You kin fight
in the middle, under the electric light, an&rsquo; whichever way the
bulls come in we kin sneak the other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s agreeable to me,&rdquo; Martin said, after consulting
with the leaders of his own gang.</p>
<p>The Eighth Street Bridge, crossing an arm of San Antonio Estuary,
was the length of three city blocks.&nbsp; In the middle of the bridge,
and at each end, were electric lights.&nbsp; No policeman could pass
those end-lights unseen.&nbsp; It was the safe place for the battle
that revived itself under Martin&rsquo;s eyelids.&nbsp; He saw the two
gangs, aggressive and sullen, rigidly keeping apart from each other
and backing their respective champions; and he saw himself and Cheese-Face
stripping.&nbsp; A short distance away lookouts were set, their task
being to watch the lighted ends of the bridge.&nbsp; A member of the
Boo Gang held Martin&rsquo;s coat, and shirt, and cap, ready to race
with them into safety in case the police interfered.&nbsp; Martin watched
himself go into the centre, facing Cheese-Face, and he heard himself
say, as he held up his hand warningly:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t no hand-shakin&rsquo; in this.&nbsp; Understand?&nbsp;
They ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but scrap.&nbsp; No throwin&rsquo; up
the sponge.&nbsp; This is a grudge-fight an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s to a finish.&nbsp;
Understand?&nbsp; Somebody&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to get licked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cheese-Face wanted to demur,&mdash;Martin could see that,&mdash;but
Cheese-Face&rsquo;s old perilous pride was touched before the two gangs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, come on,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s the
good of chewin&rsquo; de rag about it?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m wit&rsquo; cheh
to de finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they fell upon each other, like young bulls, in all the glory
of youth, with naked fists, with hatred, with desire to hurt, to maim,
to destroy.&nbsp; All the painful, thousand years&rsquo; gains of man
in his upward climb through creation were lost.&nbsp; Only the electric
light remained, a milestone on the path of the great human adventure.&nbsp;
Martin and Cheese-Face were two savages, of the stone age, of the squatting
place and the tree refuge.&nbsp; They sank lower and lower into the
muddy abyss, back into the dregs of the raw beginnings of life, striving
blindly and chemically, as atoms strive, as the star-dust of the heavens
strives, colliding, recoiling, and colliding again and eternally again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God!&nbsp; We are animals!&nbsp; Brute-beasts!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Martin muttered aloud, as he watched the progress of the fight.&nbsp;
It was to him, with his splendid power of vision, like gazing into a
kinetoscope.&nbsp; He was both onlooker and participant.&nbsp; His long
months of culture and refinement shuddered at the sight; then the present
was blotted out of his consciousness and the ghosts of the past possessed
him, and he was Martin Eden, just returned from sea and fighting Cheese-Face
on the Eighth Street Bridge.&nbsp; He suffered and toiled and sweated
and bled, and exulted when his naked knuckles smashed home.</p>
<p>They were twin whirlwinds of hatred, revolving about each other monstrously.&nbsp;
The time passed, and the two hostile gangs became very quiet.&nbsp;
They had never witnessed such intensity of ferocity, and they were awed
by it.&nbsp; The two fighters were greater brutes than they.&nbsp; The
first splendid velvet edge of youth and condition wore off, and they
fought more cautiously and deliberately.&nbsp; There had been no advantage
gained either way.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s fight,&rdquo;
Martin heard some one saying.&nbsp; Then he followed up a feint, right
and left, was fiercely countered, and felt his cheek laid open to the
bone.&nbsp; No bare knuckle had done that.&nbsp; He heard mutters of
amazement at the ghastly damage wrought, and was drenched with his own
blood.&nbsp; But he gave no sign.&nbsp; He became immensely wary, for
he was wise with knowledge of the low cunning and foul vileness of his
kind.&nbsp; He watched and waited, until he feigned a wild rush, which
he stopped midway, for he had seen the glint of metal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up yer hand!&rdquo; he screamed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them&rsquo;s
brass knuckles, an&rsquo; you hit me with &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both gangs surged forward, growling and snarling.&nbsp; In a second
there would be a free-for-all fight, and he would be robbed of his vengeance.&nbsp;
He was beside himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guys keep out!&rdquo; he screamed hoarsely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Understand?&nbsp;
Say, d&rsquo;ye understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shrank away from him.&nbsp; They were brutes, but he was the
arch-brute, a thing of terror that towered over them and dominated them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my scrap, an&rsquo; they ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to
be no buttin&rsquo; in.&nbsp; Gimme them knuckles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cheese-Face, sobered and a bit frightened, surrendered the foul weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You passed &rsquo;em to him, you red-head sneakin&rsquo; in
behind the push there,&rdquo; Martin went on, as he tossed the knuckles
into the water.&nbsp; &ldquo;I seen you, an&rsquo; I was wonderin&rsquo;
what you was up to.&nbsp; If you try anything like that again, I&rsquo;ll
beat cheh to death.&nbsp; Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They fought on, through exhaustion and beyond, to exhaustion immeasurable
and inconceivable, until the crowd of brutes, its blood-lust sated,
terrified by what it saw, begged them impartially to cease.&nbsp; And
Cheese-Face, ready to drop and die, or to stay on his legs and die,
a grisly monster out of whose features all likeness to Cheese-Face had
been beaten, wavered and hesitated; but Martin sprang in and smashed
him again and again.</p>
<p>Next, after a seeming century or so, with Cheese-Face weakening fast,
in a mix-up of blows there was a loud snap, and Martin&rsquo;s right
arm dropped to his side.&nbsp; It was a broken bone.&nbsp; Everybody
heard it and knew; and Cheese-Face knew, rushing like a tiger in the
other&rsquo;s extremity and raining blow on blow.&nbsp; Martin&rsquo;s
gang surged forward to interfere.&nbsp; Dazed by the rapid succession
of blows, Martin warned them back with vile and earnest curses sobbed
out and groaned in ultimate desolation and despair.</p>
<p>He punched on, with his left hand only, and as he punched, doggedly,
only half-conscious, as from a remote distance he heard murmurs of fear
in the gangs, and one who said with shaking voice: &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t
a scrap, fellows.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s murder, an&rsquo; we ought to stop
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no one stopped it, and he was glad, punching on wearily and endlessly
with his one arm, battering away at a bloody something before him that
was not a face but a horror, an oscillating, hideous, gibbering, nameless
thing that persisted before his wavering vision and would not go away.&nbsp;
And he punched on and on, slower and slower, as the last shreds of vitality
oozed from him, through centuries and aeons and enormous lapses of time,
until, in a dim way, he became aware that the nameless thing was sinking,
slowly sinking down to the rough board-planking of the bridge.&nbsp;
And the next moment he was standing over it, staggering and swaying
on shaky legs, clutching at the air for support, and saying in a voice
he did not recognize:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye want any more?&nbsp; Say, d&rsquo;ye want any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was still saying it, over and over,&mdash;demanding, entreating,
threatening, to know if it wanted any more,&mdash;when he felt the fellows
of his gang laying hands on him, patting him on the back and trying
to put his coat on him.&nbsp; And then came a sudden rush of blackness
and oblivion.</p>
<p>The tin alarm-clock on the table ticked on, but Martin Eden, his
face buried on his arms, did not hear it.&nbsp; He heard nothing.&nbsp;
He did not think.&nbsp; So absolutely had he relived life that he had
fainted just as he fainted years before on the Eighth Street Bridge.&nbsp;
For a full minute the blackness and the blankness endured.&nbsp; Then,
like one from the dead, he sprang upright, eyes flaming, sweat pouring
down his face, shouting:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;I licked you, Cheese-Face!&nbsp; It took me eleven years,
but I licked you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His knees were trembling under him, he felt faint, and he staggered
back to the bed, sinking down and sitting on the edge of it.&nbsp; He
was still in the clutch of the past.&nbsp; He looked about the room,
perplexed, alarmed, wondering where he was, until he caught sight of
the pile of manuscripts in the corner.&nbsp; Then the wheels of memory
slipped ahead through four years of time, and he was aware of the present,
of the books he had opened and the universe he had won from their pages,
of his dreams and ambitions, and of his love for a pale wraith of a
girl, sensitive and sheltered and ethereal, who would die of horror
did she witness but one moment of what he had just lived through&mdash;one
moment of all the muck of life through which he had waded.</p>
<p>He arose to his feet and confronted himself in the looking-glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you arise from the mud, Martin Eden,&rdquo; he said
solemnly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you cleanse your eyes in a great brightness,
and thrust your shoulders among the stars, doing what all life has done,
letting the &lsquo;ape and tiger die&rsquo; and wresting highest heritage
from all powers that be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked more closely at himself and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bit of hysteria and melodrama, eh?&rdquo; he queried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, never mind.&nbsp; You licked Cheese-Face, and you&rsquo;ll
lick the editors if it takes twice eleven years to do it in.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t stop here.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got to go on.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
to a finish, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>The alarm-clock went off, jerking Martin out of sleep with a suddenness
that would have given headache to one with less splendid constitution.&nbsp;
Though he slept soundly, he awoke instantly, like a cat, and he awoke
eagerly, glad that the five hours of unconsciousness were gone.&nbsp;
He hated the oblivion of sleep.&nbsp; There was too much to do, too
much of life to live.&nbsp; He grudged every moment of life sleep robbed
him of, and before the clock had ceased its clattering he was head and
ears in the washbasin and thrilling to the cold bite of the water.</p>
<p>But he did not follow his regular programme.&nbsp; There was no unfinished
story waiting his hand, no new story demanding articulation.&nbsp; He
had studied late, and it was nearly time for breakfast.&nbsp; He tried
to read a chapter in Fiske, but his brain was restless and he closed
the book.&nbsp; To-day witnessed the beginning of the new battle, wherein
for some time there would be no writing.&nbsp; He was aware of a sadness
akin to that with which one leaves home and family.&nbsp; He looked
at the manuscripts in the corner.&nbsp; That was it.&nbsp; He was going
away from them, his pitiful, dishonored children that were welcome nowhere.&nbsp;
He went over and began to rummage among them, reading snatches here
and there, his favorite portions.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Pot&rdquo; he honored
with reading aloud, as he did &ldquo;Adventure.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Joy,&rdquo;
his latest-born, completed the day before and tossed into the corner
for lack of stamps, won his keenest approbation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or
maybe it&rsquo;s the editors who can&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
nothing wrong with that.&nbsp; They publish worse every month.&nbsp;
Everything they publish is worse&mdash;nearly everything, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After breakfast he put the type-writer in its case and carried it
down into Oakland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe a month on it,&rdquo; he told the clerk in the store.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you tell the manager I&rsquo;m going to work and that I&rsquo;ll
be in in a month or so and straighten up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crossed on the ferry to San Francisco and made his way to an employment
office.&nbsp; &ldquo;Any kind of work, no trade,&rdquo; he told the
agent; and was interrupted by a new-comer, dressed rather foppishly,
as some workingmen dress who have instincts for finer things.&nbsp;
The agent shook his head despondently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; doin&rsquo; eh?&rdquo; said the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, I got to get somebody to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and stared at Martin, and Martin, staring back, noted the
puffed and discolored face, handsome and weak, and knew that he had
been making a night of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookin&rsquo; for a job?&rdquo; the other queried.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
can you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard labor, sailorizing, run a type-writer, no shorthand,
can sit on a horse, willing to do anything and tackle anything,&rdquo;
was the answer.</p>
<p>The other nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good to me.&nbsp; My name&rsquo;s Dawson, Joe Dawson,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; to scare up a laundryman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Martin caught an amusing glimpse
of himself ironing fluffy white things that women wear.&nbsp; But he
had taken a liking to the other, and he added: &ldquo;I might do the
plain washing.&nbsp; I learned that much at sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Joe Dawson
thought visibly for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, let&rsquo;s get together an&rsquo; frame it up.&nbsp;
Willin&rsquo; to listen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a small laundry, up country, belongs to Shelly Hot
Springs,&mdash;hotel, you know.&nbsp; Two men do the work, boss and
assistant.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the boss.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t work for
me, but you work under me.&nbsp; Think you&rsquo;d be willin&rsquo;
to learn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin paused to think.&nbsp; The prospect was alluring.&nbsp; A
few months of it, and he would have time to himself for study.&nbsp;
He could work hard and study hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good grub an&rsquo; a room to yourself,&rdquo; Joe said.</p>
<p>That settled it.&nbsp; A room to himself where he could burn the
midnight oil unmolested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But work like hell,&rdquo; the other added.</p>
<p>Martin caressed his swelling shoulder-muscles significantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That came from hard work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get to it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Joe held his hand
to his head for a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gee, but it&rsquo;s a stem-winder.&nbsp;
Can hardly see.&nbsp; I went down the line last night&mdash;everything&mdash;everything.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s the frame-up.&nbsp; The wages for two is a hundred and
board.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve ben drawin&rsquo; down sixty, the second man
forty.&nbsp; But he knew the biz.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re green.&nbsp; If
I break you in, I&rsquo;ll be doing plenty of your work at first.&nbsp;
Suppose you begin at thirty, an&rsquo; work up to the forty.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
play fair.&nbsp; Just as soon as you can do your share you get the forty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go you,&rdquo; Martin announced, stretching out
his hand, which the other shook.&nbsp; &ldquo;Any advance?&mdash;for
rail-road ticket and extras?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I blew it in,&rdquo; was Joe&rsquo;s sad answer, with another
reach at his aching head.&nbsp; &ldquo;All I got is a return ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m broke&mdash;when I pay my board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump it,&rdquo; Joe advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Owe it to my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe whistled a long, perplexed whistle, and racked his brains to
little purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the price of the drinks,&rdquo; he said desperately.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come on, an&rsquo; mebbe we&rsquo;ll cook up something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin declined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water-wagon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Martin nodded, and Joe lamented, &ldquo;Wish I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I somehow just can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said in extenuation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;After I&rsquo;ve ben workin&rsquo; like hell all week I just
got to booze up.&nbsp; If I didn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d cut my throat or
burn up the premises.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re on the wagon.&nbsp;
Stay with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin knew of the enormous gulf between him and this man&mdash;the
gulf the books had made; but he found no difficulty in crossing back
over that gulf.&nbsp; He had lived all his life in the working-class
world, and the <i>camaraderie</i> of labor was second nature with him.&nbsp;
He solved the difficulty of transportation that was too much for the
other&rsquo;s aching head.&nbsp; He would send his trunk up to Shelly
Hot Springs on Joe&rsquo;s ticket.&nbsp; As for himself, there was his
wheel.&nbsp; It was seventy miles, and he could ride it on Sunday and
be ready for work Monday morning.&nbsp; In the meantime he would go
home and pack up.&nbsp; There was no one to say good-by to.&nbsp; Ruth
and her whole family were spending the long summer in the Sierras, at
Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p>He arrived at Shelly Hot Springs, tired and dusty, on Sunday night.&nbsp;
Joe greeted him exuberantly.&nbsp; With a wet towel bound about his
aching brow, he had been at work all day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Part of last week&rsquo;s washin&rsquo; mounted up, me bein&rsquo;
away to get you,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your box arrived
all right.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s in your room.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a hell
of a thing to call a trunk.&nbsp; An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s in it?&nbsp;
Gold bricks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe sat on the bed while Martin unpacked.&nbsp; The box was a packing-case
for breakfast food, and Mr. Higginbotham had charged him half a dollar
for it.&nbsp; Two rope handles, nailed on by Martin, had technically
transformed it into a trunk eligible for the baggage-car.&nbsp; Joe
watched, with bulging eyes, a few shirts and several changes of underclothes
come out of the box, followed by books, and more books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Books clean to the bottom?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Martin nodded, and went on arranging the books on a kitchen table
which served in the room in place of a wash-stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; Joe exploded, then waited in silence for the deduction
to arise in his brain.&nbsp; At last it came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you don&rsquo;t care for the girls&mdash;much?&rdquo;
he queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I used to chase a
lot before I tackled the books.&nbsp; But since then there&rsquo;s no
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there won&rsquo;t be any time here.&nbsp; All you can
do is work an&rsquo; sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin thought of his five hours&rsquo; sleep a night, and smiled.&nbsp;
The room was situated over the laundry and was in the same building
with the engine that pumped water, made electricity, and ran the laundry
machinery.&nbsp; The engineer, who occupied the adjoining room, dropped
in to meet the new hand and helped Martin rig up an electric bulb, on
an extension wire, so that it travelled along a stretched cord from
over the table to the bed.</p>
<p>The next morning, at quarter-past six, Martin was routed out for
a quarter-to-seven breakfast.&nbsp; There happened to be a bath-tub
for the servants in the laundry building, and he electrified Joe by
taking a cold bath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, but you&rsquo;re a hummer!&rdquo; Joe announced, as they
sat down to breakfast in a corner of the hotel kitchen.</p>
<p>With them was the engineer, the gardener, and the assistant gardener,
and two or three men from the stable.&nbsp; They ate hurriedly and gloomily,
with but little conversation, and as Martin ate and listened he realized
how far he had travelled from their status.&nbsp; Their small mental
caliber was depressing to him, and he was anxious to get away from them.&nbsp;
So he bolted his breakfast, a sickly, sloppy affair, as rapidly as they,
and heaved a sigh of relief when he passed out through the kitchen door.</p>
<p>It was a perfectly appointed, small steam laundry, wherein the most
modern machinery did everything that was possible for machinery to do.&nbsp;
Martin, after a few instructions, sorted the great heaps of soiled clothes,
while Joe started the masher and made up fresh supplies of soft-soap,
compounded of biting chemicals that compelled him to swathe his mouth
and nostrils and eyes in bath-towels till he resembled a mummy.&nbsp;
Finished the sorting, Martin lent a hand in wringing the clothes.&nbsp;
This was done by dumping them into a spinning receptacle that went at
a rate of a few thousand revolutions a minute, tearing the water from
the clothes by centrifugal force.&nbsp; Then Martin began to alternate
between the dryer and the wringer, between times &ldquo;shaking out&rdquo;
socks and stockings.&nbsp; By the afternoon, one feeding and one, stacking
up, they were running socks and stockings through the mangle while the
irons were heating.&nbsp; Then it was hot irons and underclothes till
six o&rsquo;clock, at which time Joe shook his head dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Way behind,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Got to work after
supper.&rdquo;&nbsp; And after supper they worked until ten o&rsquo;clock,
under the blazing electric lights, until the last piece of under-clothing
was ironed and folded away in the distributing room.&nbsp; It was a
hot California night, and though the windows were thrown wide, the room,
with its red-hot ironing-stove, was a furnace.&nbsp; Martin and Joe,
down to undershirts, bare armed, sweated and panted for air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like trimming cargo in the tropics,&rdquo; Martin said, when
they went upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; Joe answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You take
hold like a good fellow.&nbsp; If you keep up the pace, you&rsquo;ll
be on thirty dollars only one month.&nbsp; The second month you&rsquo;ll
be gettin&rsquo; your forty.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t tell me you never
ironed before.&nbsp; I know better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never ironed a rag in my life, honestly, until to-day,&rdquo;
Martin protested.</p>
<p>He was surprised at his weariness when he got into his room, forgetful
of the fact that he had been on his feet and working without let up
for fourteen hours.&nbsp; He set the alarm clock at six, and measured
back five hours to one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He could read until then.&nbsp;
Slipping off his shoes, to ease his swollen feet, he sat down at the
table with his books.&nbsp; He opened Fiske, where he had left off to
read.&nbsp; But he found trouble and began to read it through a second time.&nbsp;
Then he awoke, in pain from his stiffened muscles and chilled by the
mountain wind that had begun to blow in through the window.&nbsp; He
looked at the clock.&nbsp; It marked two.&nbsp; He had been asleep four
hours.&nbsp; He pulled off his clothes and crawled into bed, where he
was asleep the moment after his head touched the pillow.</p>
<p>Tuesday was a day of similar unremitting toil.&nbsp; The speed with
which Joe worked won Martin&rsquo;s admiration.&nbsp; Joe was a dozen
of demons for work.&nbsp; He was keyed up to concert pitch, and there
was never a moment in the long day when he was not fighting for moments.&nbsp;
He concentrated himself upon his work and upon how to save time, pointing
out to Martin where he did in five motions what could be done in three,
or in three motions what could be done in two.&nbsp; &ldquo;Elimination
of waste motion,&rdquo; Martin phrased it as he watched and patterned
after.&nbsp; He was a good workman himself, quick and deft, and it had
always been a point of pride with him that no man should do any of his
work for him or outwork him.&nbsp; As a result, he concentrated with
a similar singleness of purpose, greedily snapping up the hints and
suggestions thrown out by his working mate.&nbsp; He &ldquo;rubbed out&rdquo;
collars and cuffs, rubbing the starch out from between the double thicknesses
of linen so that there would be no blisters when it came to the ironing,
and doing it at a pace that elicited Joe&rsquo;s praise.</p>
<p>There was never an interval when something was not at hand to be
done.&nbsp; Joe waited for nothing, waited on nothing, and went on the
jump from task to task.&nbsp; They starched two hundred white shirts,
with a single gathering movement seizing a shirt so that the wristbands,
neckband, yoke, and bosom protruded beyond the circling right hand.&nbsp;
At the same moment the left hand held up the body of the shirt so that
it would not enter the starch, and at the moment the right hand dipped
into the starch&mdash;starch so hot that, in order to wring it out,
their hands had to thrust, and thrust continually, into a bucket of
cold water.&nbsp; And that night they worked till half-past ten, dipping
&ldquo;fancy starch&rdquo;&mdash;all the frilled and airy, delicate
wear of ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me for the tropics and no clothes,&rdquo; Martin laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And me out of a job,&rdquo; Joe answered seriously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; but laundrying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know it well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to.&nbsp; Began in the Contra Costa in Oakland when
I was eleven, shakin&rsquo; out for the mangle.&nbsp; That was eighteen
years ago, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve never done a tap of anything else.&nbsp;
But this job is the fiercest I ever had.&nbsp; Ought to be one more
man on it at least.&nbsp; We work to-morrow night.&nbsp; Always run
the mangle Wednesday nights&mdash;collars an&rsquo; cuffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin set his alarm, drew up to the table, and opened Fiske.&nbsp;
He did not finish the first paragraph.&nbsp; The lines blurred and ran
together and his head nodded.&nbsp; He walked up and down, batting his
head savagely with his fists, but he could not conquer the numbness
of sleep.&nbsp; He propped the book before him, and propped his eyelids
with his fingers, and fell asleep with his eyes wide open.&nbsp; Then
he surrendered, and, scarcely conscious of what he did, got off his
clothes and into bed.&nbsp; He slept seven hours of heavy, animal-like
sleep, and awoke by the alarm, feeling that he had not had enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doin&rsquo; much readin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Joe asked.</p>
<p>Martin shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind.&nbsp; We got to run the mangle to-night, but Thursday
we&rsquo;ll knock off at six.&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll give you a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin washed woollens that day, by hand, in a large barrel, with
strong soft-soap, by means of a hub from a wagon wheel, mounted on a
plunger-pole that was attached to a spring-pole overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My invention,&rdquo; Joe said proudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beats
a washboard an&rsquo; your knuckles, and, besides, it saves at least
fifteen minutes in the week, an&rsquo; fifteen minutes ain&rsquo;t to
be sneezed at in this shebang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Running the collars and cuffs through the mangle was also Joe&rsquo;s
idea.&nbsp; That night, while they toiled on under the electric lights,
he explained it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something no laundry ever does, except this one.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
I got to do it if I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to get done Saturday afternoon
at three o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; But I know how, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
the difference.&nbsp; Got to have right heat, right pressure, and run
&rsquo;em through three times.&nbsp; Look at that!&rdquo;&nbsp; He held
a cuff aloft.&nbsp; &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t do it better by hand or on
a tiler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thursday, Joe was in a rage.&nbsp; A bundle of extra &ldquo;fancy
starch&rdquo; had come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to quit,&rdquo; he announced.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stand for it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to quit
it cold.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the good of me workin&rsquo; like a slave
all week, a-savin&rsquo; minutes, an&rsquo; them a-comin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
ringin&rsquo; in fancy-starch extras on me?&nbsp; This is a free country,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m to tell that fat Dutchman what I think of him.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;m in French.&nbsp; Plain United
States is good enough for me.&nbsp; Him a-ringin&rsquo; in fancy starch
extras!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got to work to-night,&rdquo; he said the next moment, reversing
his judgment and surrendering to fate.</p>
<p>And Martin did no reading that night.&nbsp; He had seen no daily
paper all week, and, strangely to him, felt no desire to see one.&nbsp;
He was not interested in the news.&nbsp; He was too tired and jaded
to be interested in anything, though he planned to leave Saturday afternoon,
if they finished at three, and ride on his wheel to Oakland.&nbsp; It
was seventy miles, and the same distance back on Sunday afternoon would
leave him anything but rested for the second week&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;
It would have been easier to go on the train, but the round trip was
two dollars and a half, and he was intent on saving money.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>Martin learned to do many things.&nbsp; In the course of the first
week, in one afternoon, he and Joe accounted for the two hundred white
shirts.&nbsp; Joe ran the tiler, a machine wherein a hot iron was hooked
on a steel string which furnished the pressure.&nbsp; By this means
he ironed the yoke, wristbands, and neckband, setting the latter at
right angles to the shirt, and put the glossy finish on the bosom.&nbsp;
As fast as he finished them, he flung the shirts on a rack between him
and Martin, who caught them up and &ldquo;backed&rdquo; them.&nbsp;
This task consisted of ironing all the unstarched portions of the shirts.</p>
<p>It was exhausting work, carried on, hour after hour, at top speed.&nbsp;
Out on the broad verandas of the hotel, men and women, in cool white,
sipped iced drinks and kept their circulation down.&nbsp; But in the
laundry the air was sizzling.&nbsp; The huge stove roared red hot and
white hot, while the irons, moving over the damp cloth, sent up clouds
of steam.&nbsp; The heat of these irons was different from that used
by housewives.&nbsp; An iron that stood the ordinary test of a wet finger
was too cold for Joe and Martin, and such test was useless.&nbsp; They
went wholly by holding the irons close to their cheeks, gauging the
heat by some secret mental process that Martin admired but could not
understand.&nbsp; When the fresh irons proved too hot, they hooked them
on iron rods and dipped them into cold water.&nbsp; This again required
a precise and subtle judgment.&nbsp; A fraction of a second too long
in the water and the fine and silken edge of the proper heat was lost,
and Martin found time to marvel at the accuracy he developed&mdash;an
automatic accuracy, founded upon criteria that were machine-like and
unerring.</p>
<p>But there was little time in which to marvel.&nbsp; All Martin&rsquo;s
consciousness was concentrated in the work.&nbsp; Ceaselessly active,
head and hand, an intelligent machine, all that constituted him a man
was devoted to furnishing that intelligence.&nbsp; There was no room
in his brain for the universe and its mighty problems.&nbsp; All the
broad and spacious corridors of his mind were closed and hermetically
sealed.&nbsp; The echoing chamber of his soul was a narrow room, a conning
tower, whence were directed his arm and shoulder muscles, his ten nimble
fingers, and the swift-moving iron along its steaming path in broad,
sweeping strokes, just so many strokes and no more, just so far with
each stroke and not a fraction of an inch farther, rushing along interminable
sleeves, sides, backs, and tails, and tossing the finished shirts, without
rumpling, upon the receiving frame.&nbsp; And even as his hurrying soul
tossed, it was reaching for another shirt.&nbsp; This went on, hour
after hour, while outside all the world swooned under the overhead California
sun.&nbsp; But there was no swooning in that superheated room.&nbsp;
The cool guests on the verandas needed clean linen.</p>
<p>The sweat poured from Martin.&nbsp; He drank enormous quantities
of water, but so great was the heat of the day and of his exertions,
that the water sluiced through the interstices of his flesh and out
at all his pores.&nbsp; Always, at sea, except at rare intervals, the
work he performed had given him ample opportunity to commune with himself.&nbsp;
The master of the ship had been lord of Martin&rsquo;s time; but here
the manager of the hotel was lord of Martin&rsquo;s thoughts as well.&nbsp;
He had no thoughts save for the nerve-racking, body-destroying toil.&nbsp;
Outside of that it was impossible to think.&nbsp; He did not know that
he loved Ruth.&nbsp; She did not even exist, for his driven soul had
no time to remember her.&nbsp; It was only when he crawled to bed at
night, or to breakfast in the morning, that she asserted herself to
him in fleeting memories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is hell, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Joe remarked once.</p>
<p>Martin nodded, but felt a rasp of irritation.&nbsp; The statement
had been obvious and unnecessary.&nbsp; They did not talk while they
worked.&nbsp; Conversation threw them out of their stride, as it did
this time, compelling Martin to miss a stroke of his iron and to make
two extra motions before he caught his stride again.</p>
<p>On Friday morning the washer ran.&nbsp; Twice a week they had to
put through hotel linen,&mdash;the sheets, pillow-slips, spreads, table-cloths,
and napkins.&nbsp; This finished, they buckled down to &ldquo;fancy
starch.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was slow work, fastidious and delicate, and
Martin did not learn it so readily.&nbsp; Besides, he could not take
chances.&nbsp; Mistakes were disastrous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that,&rdquo; Joe said, holding up a filmy corset-cover
that he could have crumpled from view in one hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Scorch
that an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s twenty dollars out of your wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Martin did not scorch that, and eased down on his muscular tension,
though nervous tension rose higher than ever, and he listened sympathetically
to the other&rsquo;s blasphemies as he toiled and suffered over the
beautiful things that women wear when they do not have to do their own
laundrying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy starch&rdquo; was Martin&rsquo;s nightmare,
and it was Joe&rsquo;s, too.&nbsp; It was &ldquo;fancy starch&rdquo;
that robbed them of their hard-won minutes.&nbsp; They toiled at it
all day.&nbsp; At seven in the evening they broke off to run the hotel
linen through the mangle.&nbsp; At ten o&rsquo;clock, while the hotel
guests slept, the two laundrymen sweated on at &ldquo;fancy starch&rdquo;
till midnight, till one, till two.&nbsp; At half-past two they knocked
off.</p>
<p>Saturday morning it was &ldquo;fancy starch,&rdquo; and odds and
ends, and at three in the afternoon the week&rsquo;s work was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to ride them seventy miles into
Oakland on top of this?&rdquo; Joe demanded, as they sat on the stairs
and took a triumphant smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you goin&rsquo; for?&mdash;a girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; to save two and a half on the railroad ticket.&nbsp; I
want to renew some books at the library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you send &rsquo;em down an&rsquo; up by express?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;ll cost only a quarter each way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin considered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; take a rest to-morrow,&rdquo; the other urged.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You need it.&nbsp; I know I do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m plumb tuckered
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked it.&nbsp; Indomitable, never resting, fighting for seconds
and minutes all week, circumventing delays and crushing down obstacles,
a fount of resistless energy, a high-driven human motor, a demon for
work, now that he had accomplished the week&rsquo;s task he was in a
state of collapse.&nbsp; He was worn and haggard, and his handsome face
drooped in lean exhaustion.&nbsp; He pulled his cigarette spiritlessly,
and his voice was peculiarly dead and monotonous.&nbsp; All the snap
and fire had gone out of him.&nbsp; His triumph seemed a sorry one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; next week we got to do it all over again,&rdquo;
he said sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s the good of it all,
hey?&nbsp; Sometimes I wish I was a hobo.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t work,
an&rsquo; they get their livin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Gee!&nbsp; I wish I had
a glass of beer; but I can&rsquo;t get up the gumption to go down to
the village an&rsquo; get it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll stay over, an&rsquo;
send your books dawn by express, or else you&rsquo;re a damn fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can I do here all day Sunday?&rdquo; Martin asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know how tired you are.&nbsp;
Why, I&rsquo;m that tired Sunday I can&rsquo;t even read the papers.&nbsp;
I was sick once&mdash;typhoid.&nbsp; In the hospital two months an&rsquo;
a half.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t do a tap of work all that time.&nbsp; It
was beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was beautiful,&rdquo; he repeated dreamily, a minute later.</p>
<p>Martin took a bath, after which he found that the head laundryman
had disappeared.&nbsp; Most likely he had gone for a glass of beer Martin
decided, but the half-mile walk down to the village to find out seemed
a long journey to him.&nbsp; He lay on his bed with his shoes off, trying
to make up his mind.&nbsp; He did not reach out for a book.&nbsp; He
was too tired to feel sleepy, and he lay, scarcely thinking, in a semi-stupor
of weariness, until it was time for supper.&nbsp; Joe did not appear
for that function, and when Martin heard the gardener remark that most
likely he was ripping the slats off the bar, Martin understood.&nbsp;
He went to bed immediately afterward, and in the morning decided that
he was greatly rested.&nbsp; Joe being still absent, Martin procured
a Sunday paper and lay down in a shady nook under the trees.&nbsp; The
morning passed, he knew not how.&nbsp; He did not sleep, nobody disturbed
him, and he did not finish the paper.&nbsp; He came back to it in the
afternoon, after dinner, and fell asleep over it.</p>
<p>So passed Sunday, and Monday morning he was hard at work, sorting
clothes, while Joe, a towel bound tightly around his head, with groans
and blasphemies, was running the washer and mixing soft-soap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
got to drink when Saturday night comes around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another week passed, a great battle that continued under the electric
lights each night and that culminated on Saturday afternoon at three
o&rsquo;clock, when Joe tasted his moment of wilted triumph and then
drifted down to the village to forget.&nbsp; Martin&rsquo;s Sunday was
the same as before.&nbsp; He slept in the shade of the trees, toiled
aimlessly through the newspaper, and spent long hours lying on his back,
doing nothing, thinking nothing.&nbsp; He was too dazed to think, though
he was aware that he did not like himself.&nbsp; He was self-repelled,
as though he had undergone some degradation or was intrinsically foul.&nbsp;
All that was god-like in him was blotted out.&nbsp; The spur of ambition
was blunted; he had no vitality with which to feel the prod of it.&nbsp;
He was dead.&nbsp; His soul seemed dead.&nbsp; He was a beast, a work-beast.&nbsp;
He saw no beauty in the sunshine sifting down through the green leaves,
nor did the azure vault of the sky whisper as of old and hint of cosmic
vastness and secrets trembling to disclosure.&nbsp; Life was intolerably
dull and stupid, and its taste was bad in his mouth.&nbsp; A black screen
was drawn across his mirror of inner vision, and fancy lay in a darkened
sick-room where entered no ray of light.&nbsp; He envied Joe, down in
the village, rampant, tearing the slats off the bar, his brain gnawing
with maggots, exulting in maudlin ways over maudlin things, fantastically
and gloriously drunk and forgetful of Monday morning and the week of
deadening toil to come.</p>
<p>A third week went by, and Martin loathed himself, and loathed life.&nbsp;
He was oppressed by a sense of failure.&nbsp; There was reason for the
editors refusing his stuff.&nbsp; He could see that clearly now, and
laugh at himself and the dreams he had dreamed.&nbsp; Ruth returned
his &ldquo;Sea Lyrics&rdquo; by mail.&nbsp; He read her letter apathetically.&nbsp;
She did her best to say how much she liked them and that they were beautiful.&nbsp;
But she could not lie, and she could not disguise the truth from herself.&nbsp;
She knew they were failures, and he read her disapproval in every perfunctory
and unenthusiastic line of her letter.&nbsp; And she was right.&nbsp;
He was firmly convinced of it as he read the poems over.&nbsp; Beauty
and wonder had departed from him, and as he read the poems he caught
himself puzzling as to what he had had in mind when he wrote them.&nbsp;
His audacities of phrase struck him as grotesque, his felicities of
expression were monstrosities, and everything was absurd, unreal, and
impossible.&nbsp; He would have burned the &ldquo;Sea Lyrics&rdquo;
on the spot, had his will been strong enough to set them aflame.&nbsp;
There was the engine-room, but the exertion of carrying them to the
furnace was not worth while.&nbsp; All his exertion was used in washing
other persons&rsquo; clothes.&nbsp; He did not have any left for private
affairs.</p>
<p>He resolved that when Sunday came he would pull himself together
and answer Ruth&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; But Saturday afternoon, after
work was finished and he had taken a bath, the desire to forget overpowered
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll go down and see how Joe&rsquo;s
getting on,&rdquo; was the way he put it to himself; and in the same
moment he knew that he lied.&nbsp; But he did not have the energy to
consider the lie.&nbsp; If he had had the energy, he would have refused
to consider the lie, because he wanted to forget.&nbsp; He started for
the village slowly and casually, increasing his pace in spite of himself
as he neared the saloon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you was on the water-wagon,&rdquo; was Joe&rsquo;s
greeting.</p>
<p>Martin did not deign to offer excuses, but called for whiskey, filling
his own glass brimming before he passed the bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take all night about it,&rdquo; he said roughly.</p>
<p>The other was dawdling with the bottle, and Martin refused to wait
for him, tossing the glass off in a gulp and refilling it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I can wait for you,&rdquo; he said grimly; &ldquo;but
hurry up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe hurried, and they drank together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work did it, eh?&rdquo; Joe queried.</p>
<p>Martin refused to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fair hell, I know,&rdquo; the other went on, &ldquo;but
I kind of hate to see you come off the wagon, Mart.&nbsp; Well, here&rsquo;s
how!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin drank on silently, biting out his orders and invitations and
awing the barkeeper, an effeminate country youngster with watery blue
eyes and hair parted in the middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something scandalous the way they work us poor
devils,&rdquo; Joe was remarking.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t bowl
up, I&rsquo;d break loose an&rsquo; burn down the shebang.&nbsp; My
bowlin&rsquo; up is all that saves &rsquo;em, I can tell you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Martin made no answer.&nbsp; A few more drinks, and in his brain
he felt the maggots of intoxication beginning to crawl.&nbsp; Ah, it
was living, the first breath of life he had breathed in three weeks.&nbsp;
His dreams came back to him.&nbsp; Fancy came out of the darkened room
and lured him on, a thing of flaming brightness.&nbsp; His mirror of
vision was silver-clear, a flashing, dazzling palimpsest of imagery.&nbsp;
Wonder and beauty walked with him, hand in hand, and all power was his.&nbsp;
He tried to tell it to Joe, but Joe had visions of his own, infallible
schemes whereby he would escape the slavery of laundry-work and become
himself the owner of a great steam laundry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell yeh, Mart, they won&rsquo;t be no kids workin&rsquo;
in my laundry&mdash;not on yer life.&nbsp; An&rsquo; they won&rsquo;t
be no workin&rsquo; a livin&rsquo; soul after six P.M.&nbsp; You hear
me talk!&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be machinery enough an&rsquo; hands enough
to do it all in decent workin&rsquo; hours, an&rsquo; Mart, s&rsquo;help
me, I&rsquo;ll make yeh superintendent of the shebang&mdash;the whole
of it, all of it.&nbsp; Now here&rsquo;s the scheme.&nbsp; I get on
the water-wagon an&rsquo; save my money for two years&mdash;save an&rsquo;
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Martin turned away, leaving him to tell it to the barkeeper,
until that worthy was called away to furnish drinks to two farmers who,
coming in, accepted Martin&rsquo;s invitation.&nbsp; Martin dispensed
royal largess, inviting everybody up, farm-hands, a stableman, and the
gardener&rsquo;s assistant from the hotel, the barkeeper, and the furtive
hobo who slid in like a shadow and like a shadow hovered at the end
of the bar.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>Monday morning, Joe groaned over the first truck load of clothes
to the washer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me,&rdquo; Martin snarled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Joe,&rdquo; he said at noon, when they knocked
off for dinner.</p>
<p>Tears came into the other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, old man,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
in hell, an&rsquo; we can&rsquo;t help ourselves.&nbsp; An&rsquo;, you
know, I kind of like you a whole lot.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what made it&mdash;hurt.&nbsp;
I cottoned to you from the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin shook his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s quit,&rdquo; Joe suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
chuck it, an&rsquo; go hoboin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t never tried
it, but it must be dead easy.&nbsp; An&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; to do.&nbsp;
Just think of it, nothin&rsquo; to do.&nbsp; I was sick once, typhoid,
in the hospital, an&rsquo; it was beautiful.&nbsp; I wish I&rsquo;d
get sick again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The week dragged on.&nbsp; The hotel was full, and extra &ldquo;fancy
starch&rdquo; poured in upon them.&nbsp; They performed prodigies of
valor.&nbsp; They fought late each night under the electric lights,
bolted their meals, and even got in a half hour&rsquo;s work before
breakfast.&nbsp; Martin no longer took his cold baths.&nbsp; Every moment
was drive, drive, drive, and Joe was the masterful shepherd of moments,
herding them carefully, never losing one, counting them over like a
miser counting gold, working on in a frenzy, toil-mad, a feverish machine,
aided ably by that other machine that thought of itself as once having
been one Martin Eden, a man.</p>
<p>But it was only at rare moments that Martin was able to think.&nbsp;
The house of thought was closed, its windows boarded up, and he was
its shadowy caretaker.&nbsp; He was a shadow.&nbsp; Joe was right.&nbsp;
They were both shadows, and this was the unending limbo of toil.&nbsp;
Or was it a dream?&nbsp; Sometimes, in the steaming, sizzling heat,
as he swung the heavy irons back and forth over the white garments,
it came to him that it was a dream.&nbsp; In a short while, or maybe
after a thousand years or so, he would awake, in his little room with
the ink-stained table, and take up his writing where he had left off
the day before.&nbsp; Or maybe that was a dream, too, and the awakening
would be the changing of the watches, when he would drop down out of
his bunk in the lurching forecastle and go up on deck, under the tropic
stars, and take the wheel and feel the cool tradewind blowing through
his flesh.</p>
<p>Came Saturday and its hollow victory at three o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll go down an&rsquo; get a glass of beer,&rdquo;
Joe said, in the queer, monotonous tones that marked his week-end collapse.</p>
<p>Martin seemed suddenly to wake up.&nbsp; He opened the kit bag and
oiled his wheel, putting graphite on the chain and adjusting the bearings.&nbsp;
Joe was halfway down to the saloon when Martin passed by, bending low
over the handle-bars, his legs driving the ninety-six gear with rhythmic
strength, his face set for seventy miles of road and grade and dust.&nbsp;
He slept in Oakland that night, and on Sunday covered the seventy miles
back.&nbsp; And on Monday morning, weary, he began the new week&rsquo;s
work, but he had kept sober.</p>
<p>A fifth week passed, and a sixth, during which he lived and toiled
as a machine, with just a spark of something more in him, just a glimmering
bit of soul, that compelled him, at each week-end, to scorch off the
hundred and forty miles.&nbsp; But this was not rest.&nbsp; It was super-machinelike,
and it helped to crush out the glimmering bit of soul that was all that
was left him from former life.&nbsp; At the end of the seventh week,
without intending it, too weak to resist, he drifted down to the village
with Joe and drowned life and found life until Monday morning.</p>
<p>Again, at the week-ends, he ground out the one hundred and forty
miles, obliterating the numbness of too great exertion by the numbness
of still greater exertion.&nbsp; At the end of three months he went
down a third time to the village with Joe.&nbsp; He forgot, and lived
again, and, living, he saw, in clear illumination, the beast he was
making of himself&mdash;not by the drink, but by the work.&nbsp; The
drink was an effect, not a cause.&nbsp; It followed inevitably upon
the work, as the night follows upon the day.&nbsp; Not by becoming a
toil-beast could he win to the heights, was the message the whiskey
whispered to him, and he nodded approbation.&nbsp; The whiskey was wise.&nbsp;
It told secrets on itself.</p>
<p>He called for paper and pencil, and for drinks all around, and while
they drank his very good health, he clung to the bar and scribbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A telegram, Joe,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe read it with a drunken, quizzical leer.&nbsp; But what he read
seemed to sober him.&nbsp; He looked at the other reproachfully, tears
oozing into his eyes and down his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; back on me, Mart?&rdquo; he queried
hopelessly.</p>
<p>Martin nodded, and called one of the loungers to him to take the
message to the telegraph office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Joe muttered thickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lemme think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held on to the bar, his legs wobbling under him, Martin&rsquo;s
arm around him and supporting him, while he thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make that two laundrymen,&rdquo; he said abruptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,
lemme fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you quitting for?&rdquo; Martin demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same reason as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to sea.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;but I can hobo all right,
all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin looked at him searchingly for a moment, then cried:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God, I think you&rsquo;re right!&nbsp; Better a hobo than
a beast of toil.&nbsp; Why, man, you&rsquo;ll live.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s
more than you ever did before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in hospital, once,&rdquo; Joe corrected.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
was beautiful.&nbsp; Typhoid&mdash;did I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Martin changed the telegram to &ldquo;two laundrymen,&rdquo;
Joe went on:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never wanted to drink when I was in hospital.&nbsp; Funny,
ain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; But when I&rsquo;ve ben workin&rsquo; like a slave
all week, I just got to bowl up.&nbsp; Ever noticed that cooks drink
like hell?&mdash;an&rsquo; bakers, too?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the work.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve sure got to.&nbsp; Here, lemme pay half of that telegram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shake you for it,&rdquo; Martin offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, everybody drink,&rdquo; Joe called, as they rattled
the dice and rolled them out on the damp bar.</p>
<p>Monday morning Joe was wild with anticipation.&nbsp; He did not mind
his aching head, nor did he take interest in his work.&nbsp; Whole herds
of moments stole away and were lost while their careless shepherd gazed
out of the window at the sunshine and the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look at it!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
all mine!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s free.&nbsp; I can lie down under them trees
an&rsquo; sleep for a thousan&rsquo; years if I want to.&nbsp; Aw, come
on, Mart, let&rsquo;s chuck it.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the good of waitin&rsquo;
another moment.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the land of nothin&rsquo; to do out
there, an&rsquo; I got a ticket for it&mdash;an&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t
no return ticket, b&rsquo;gosh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, filling the truck with soiled clothes for the
washer, Joe spied the hotel manager&rsquo;s shirt.&nbsp; He knew its
mark, and with a sudden glorious consciousness of freedom he threw it
on the floor and stamped on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you was in it, you pig-headed Dutchman!&rdquo; he shouted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In it, an&rsquo; right there where I&rsquo;ve got you!&nbsp;
Take that! an&rsquo; that! an&rsquo; that! damn you!&nbsp; Hold me back,
somebody!&nbsp; Hold me back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin laughed and held him to his work.&nbsp; On Tuesday night the
new laundrymen arrived, and the rest of the week was spent breaking
them into the routine.&nbsp; Joe sat around and explained his system,
but he did no more work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a tap,&rdquo; he announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not a tap.&nbsp;
They can fire me if they want to, but if they do, I&rsquo;ll quit.&nbsp;
No more work in mine, thank you kindly.&nbsp; Me for the freight cars
an&rsquo; the shade under the trees.&nbsp; Go to it, you slaves!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; Slave an&rsquo; sweat!&nbsp; Slave an&rsquo;
sweat!&nbsp; An&rsquo; when you&rsquo;re dead, you&rsquo;ll rot the
same as me, an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s it matter how you live?&mdash;eh?&nbsp;
Tell me that&mdash;what&rsquo;s it matter in the long run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Saturday they drew their pay and came to the parting of the ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t no use in me askin&rsquo; you to change your
mind an&rsquo; hit the road with me?&rdquo; Joe asked hopelessly:</p>
<p>Martin shook his head.&nbsp; He was standing by his wheel, ready
to start.&nbsp; They shook hands, and Joe held on to his for a moment,
as he said:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to see you again, Mart, before you an&rsquo;
me die.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s straight dope.&nbsp; I feel it in my bones.&nbsp;
Good-by, Mart, an&rsquo; be good.&nbsp; I like you like hell, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood, a forlorn figure, in the middle of the road, watching until
Martin turned a bend and was gone from sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good Indian, that boy,&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A good Indian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he plodded down the road himself, to the water tank, where half
a dozen empties lay on a side-track waiting for the up freight.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>Ruth and her family were home again, and Martin, returned to Oakland,
saw much of her.&nbsp; Having gained her degree, she was doing no more
studying; and he, having worked all vitality out of his mind and body,
was doing no writing.&nbsp; This gave them time for each other that
they had never had before, and their intimacy ripened fast.</p>
<p>At first, Martin had done nothing but rest.&nbsp; He had slept a
great deal, and spent long hours musing and thinking and doing nothing.&nbsp;
He was like one recovering from some terrible bout of hardship.&nbsp;
The first signs of reawakening came when he discovered more than languid
interest in the daily paper.&nbsp; Then he began to read again&mdash;light
novels, and poetry; and after several days more he was head over heels
in his long-neglected Fiske.&nbsp; His splendid body and health made
new vitality, and he possessed all the resiliency and rebound of youth.</p>
<p>Ruth showed her disappointment plainly when he announced that he
was going to sea for another voyage as soon as he was well rested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to do that?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money,&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
to lay in a supply for my next attack on the editors.&nbsp; Money is
the sinews of war, in my case&mdash;money and patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if all you wanted was money, why didn&rsquo;t you stay
in the laundry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the laundry was making a beast of me.&nbsp; Too much
work of that sort drives to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared at him with horror in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;?&rdquo; she quavered.</p>
<p>It would have been easy for him to get out of it; but his natural
impulse was for frankness, and he remembered his old resolve to be frank,
no matter what happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just that.&nbsp; Several
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shivered and drew away from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No man that I have ever known did that&mdash;ever did that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they never worked in the laundry at Shelly Hot Springs,&rdquo;
he laughed bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Toil is a good thing.&nbsp; It is
necessary for human health, so all the preachers say, and Heaven knows
I&rsquo;ve never been afraid of it.&nbsp; But there is such a thing
as too much of a good thing, and the laundry up there is one of them.&nbsp;
And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to sea one more voyage.&nbsp; It
will be my last, I think, for when I come back, I shall break into the
magazines.&nbsp; I am certain of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent, unsympathetic, and he watched her moodily, realizing
how impossible it was for her to understand what he had been through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day I shall write it up&mdash;&lsquo;The Degradation
of Toil&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Psychology of Drink in the Working-class,&rsquo;
or something like that for a title.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never, since the first meeting, had they seemed so far apart as that
day.&nbsp; His confession, told in frankness, with the spirit of revolt
behind, had repelled her.&nbsp; But she was more shocked by the repulsion
itself than by the cause of it.&nbsp; It pointed out to her how near
she had drawn to him, and once accepted, it paved the way for greater
intimacy.&nbsp; Pity, too, was aroused, and innocent, idealistic thoughts
of reform.&nbsp; She would save this raw young man who had come so far.&nbsp;
She would save him from the curse of his early environment, and she
would save him from himself in spite of himself.&nbsp; And all this
affected her as a very noble state of consciousness; nor did she dream
that behind it and underlying it were the jealousy and desire of love.</p>
<p>They rode on their wheels much in the delightful fall weather, and
out in the hills they read poetry aloud, now one and now the other,
noble, uplifting poetry that turned one&rsquo;s thoughts to higher things.&nbsp;
Renunciation, sacrifice, patience, industry, and high endeavor were
the principles she thus indirectly preached&mdash;such abstractions
being objectified in her mind by her father, and Mr. Butler, and by
Andrew Carnegie, who, from a poor immigrant boy had arisen to be the
book-giver of the world.&nbsp; All of which was appreciated and enjoyed
by Martin.&nbsp; He followed her mental processes more clearly now,
and her soul was no longer the sealed wonder it had been.&nbsp; He was
on terms of intellectual equality with her.&nbsp; But the points of
disagreement did not affect his love.&nbsp; His love was more ardent
than ever, for he loved her for what she was, and even her physical
frailty was an added charm in his eyes.&nbsp; He read of sickly Elizabeth
Barrett, who for years had not placed her feet upon the ground, until
that day of flame when she eloped with Browning and stood upright, upon
the earth, under the open sky; and what Browning had done for her, Martin
decided he could do for Ruth.&nbsp; But first, she must love him.&nbsp;
The rest would be easy.&nbsp; He would give her strength and health.&nbsp;
And he caught glimpses of their life, in the years to come, wherein,
against a background of work and comfort and general well-being, he
saw himself and Ruth reading and discussing poetry, she propped amid
a multitude of cushions on the ground while she read aloud to him.&nbsp;
This was the key to the life they would live.&nbsp; And always he saw
that particular picture.&nbsp; Sometimes it was she who leaned against
him while he read, one arm about her, her head upon his shoulder.&nbsp;
Sometimes they pored together over the printed pages of beauty.&nbsp;
Then, too, she loved nature, and with generous imagination he changed
the scene of their reading&mdash;sometimes they read in closed-in valleys
with precipitous walls, or in high mountain meadows, and, again, down
by the gray sand-dunes with a wreath of billows at their feet, or afar
on some volcanic tropic isle where waterfalls descended and became mist,
reaching the sea in vapor veils that swayed and shivered to every vagrant
wisp of wind.&nbsp; But always, in the foreground, lords of beauty and
eternally reading and sharing, lay he and Ruth, and always in the background
that was beyond the background of nature, dim and hazy, were work and
success and money earned that made them free of the world and all its
treasures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should recommend my little girl to be careful,&rdquo; her
mother warned her one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean.&nbsp; But it is impossible.&nbsp; He
is not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth was blushing, but it was the blush of maidenhood called upon
for the first time to discuss the sacred things of life with a mother
held equally sacred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your kind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her mother finished the sentence for
her.</p>
<p>Ruth nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not want to say it, but he is not.&nbsp; He is rough,
brutal, strong&mdash;too strong.&nbsp; He has not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated and could not go on.&nbsp; It was a new experience,
talking over such matters with her mother.&nbsp; And again her mother
completed her thought for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not lived a clean life, is what you wanted to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Ruth nodded, and again a blush mantled her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just that,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has not
been his fault, but he has played much with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pitch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with pitch.&nbsp; And he frightens me.&nbsp; Sometimes
I am positively in terror of him, when he talks in that free and easy
way of the things he has done&mdash;as if they did not matter.&nbsp;
They do matter, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat with their arms twined around each other, and in the pause
her mother patted her hand and waited for her to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am interested in him dreadfully,&rdquo; she continued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In a way he is my prot&eacute;g&eacute;.&nbsp; Then, too, he
is my first boy friend&mdash;but not exactly friend; rather prot&eacute;g&eacute;
and friend combined.&nbsp; Sometimes, too, when he frightens me, it
seems that he is a bulldog I have taken for a plaything, like some of
the &lsquo;frat&rsquo; girls, and he is tugging hard, and showing his
teeth, and threatening to break loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again her mother waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He interests me, I suppose, like the bulldog.&nbsp; And there
is much good in him, too; but there is much in him that I would not
like in&mdash;in the other way.&nbsp; You see, I have been thinking.&nbsp;
He swears, he smokes, he drinks, he has fought with his fists (he has
told me so, and he likes it; he says so).&nbsp; He is all that a man
should not be&mdash;a man I would want for my&mdash;&rdquo; her voice
sank very low&mdash;&ldquo;husband.&nbsp; Then he is too strong.&nbsp;
My prince must be tall, and slender, and dark&mdash;a graceful, bewitching
prince.&nbsp; No, there is no danger of my failing in love with Martin
Eden.&nbsp; It would be the worst fate that could befall me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is not that that I spoke about,&rdquo; her mother equivocated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you thought about him?&nbsp; He is so ineligible in every
way, you know, and suppose he should come to love you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he does&mdash;already,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was to be expected,&rdquo; Mrs. Morse said gently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How could it be otherwise with any one who knew you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Olney hates me!&rdquo; she exclaimed passionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
I hate Olney.&nbsp; I feel always like a cat when he is around.&nbsp;
I feel that I must be nasty to him, and even when I don&rsquo;t happen
to feel that way, why, he&rsquo;s nasty to me, anyway.&nbsp; But I am
happy with Martin Eden.&nbsp; No one ever loved me before&mdash;no man,
I mean, in that way.&nbsp; And it is sweet to be loved&mdash;that way.&nbsp;
You know what I mean, mother dear.&nbsp; It is sweet to feel that you
are really and truly a woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; She buried her face in her
mother&rsquo;s lap, sobbing.&nbsp; &ldquo;You think I am dreadful, I
know, but I am honest, and I tell you just how I feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morse was strangely sad and happy.&nbsp; Her child-daughter,
who was a bachelor of arts, was gone; but in her place was a woman-daughter.&nbsp;
The experiment had succeeded.&nbsp; The strange void in Ruth&rsquo;s
nature had been filled, and filled without danger or penalty.&nbsp;
This rough sailor-fellow had been the instrument, and, though Ruth did
not love him, he had made her conscious of her womanhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His hand trembles,&rdquo; Ruth was confessing, her face, for
shame&rsquo;s sake, still buried.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is most amusing and
ridiculous, but I feel sorry for him, too.&nbsp; And when his hands
are too trembly, and his eyes too shiny, why, I lecture him about his
life and the wrong way he is going about it to mend it.&nbsp; But he
worships me, I know.&nbsp; His eyes and his hands do not lie.&nbsp;
And it makes me feel grown-up, the thought of it, the very thought of
it; and I feel that I am possessed of something that is by rights my
own&mdash;that makes me like the other girls&mdash;and&mdash;and young
women.&nbsp; And, then, too, I knew that I was not like them before,
and I knew that it worried you.&nbsp; You thought you did not let me
know that dear worry of yours, but I did, and I wanted to&mdash;&lsquo;to
make good,&rsquo; as Martin Eden says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a holy hour for mother and daughter, and their eyes were wet
as they talked on in the twilight, Ruth all white innocence and frankness,
her mother sympathetic, receptive, yet calmly explaining and guiding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is four years younger than you,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He has no place in the world.&nbsp; He has neither position nor
salary.&nbsp; He is impractical.&nbsp; Loving you, he should, in the
name of common sense, be doing something that would give him the right
to marry, instead of paltering around with those stories of his and
with childish dreams.&nbsp; Martin Eden, I am afraid, will never grow
up.&nbsp; He does not take to responsibility and a man&rsquo;s work
in the world like your father did, or like all our friends, Mr. Butler
for one.&nbsp; Martin Eden, I am afraid, will never be a money-earner.&nbsp;
And this world is so ordered that money is necessary to happiness&mdash;oh,
no, not these swollen fortunes, but enough of money to permit of common
comfort and decency.&nbsp; He&mdash;he has never spoken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not breathed a word.&nbsp; He has not attempted to;
but if he did, I would not let him, because, you see, I do not love
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad of that.&nbsp; I should not care to see my daughter,
my one daughter, who is so clean and pure, love a man like him.&nbsp;
There are noble men in the world who are clean and true and manly.&nbsp;
Wait for them.&nbsp; You will find one some day, and you will love him
and be loved by him, and you will be happy with him as your father and
I have been happy with each other.&nbsp; And there is one thing you
must always carry in mind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morse&rsquo;s voice was low and sweet as she said, &ldquo;And
that is the children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;have thought about them,&rdquo; Ruth confessed, remembering
the wanton thoughts that had vexed her in the past, her face again red
with maiden shame that she should be telling such things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is that, the children, that makes Mr. Eden impossible,&rdquo;
Mrs. Morse went on incisively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their heritage must be clean,
and he is, I am afraid, not clean.&nbsp; Your father has told me of
sailors&rsquo; lives, and&mdash;and you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth pressed her mother&rsquo;s hand in assent, feeling that she
really did understand, though her conception was of something vague,
remote, and terrible that was beyond the scope of imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I do nothing without telling you,&rdquo; she began.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&mdash;Only, sometimes you must ask me, like this time.&nbsp;
I wanted to tell you, but I did not know how.&nbsp; It is false modesty,
I know it is that, but you can make it easy for me.&nbsp; Sometimes,
like this time, you must ask me, you must give me a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, you are a woman, too!&rdquo; she cried exultantly,
as they stood up, catching her mother&rsquo;s hands and standing erect,
facing her in the twilight, conscious of a strangely sweet equality
between them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should never have thought of you in that
way if we had not had this talk.&nbsp; I had to learn that I was a woman
to know that you were one, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are women together,&rdquo; her mother said, drawing her
to her and kissing her.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are women together,&rdquo; she
repeated, as they went out of the room, their arms around each other&rsquo;s
waists, their hearts swelling with a new sense of companionship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our little girl has become a woman,&rdquo; Mrs. Morse said
proudly to her husband an hour later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means,&rdquo; he said, after a long look at his wife,
&ldquo;that means she is in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but that she is loved,&rdquo; was the smiling rejoinder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The experiment has succeeded.&nbsp; She is awakened at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to get rid of him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Morse spoke briskly, in matter-of-fact, businesslike tones.</p>
<p>But his wife shook her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will not be necessary.&nbsp;
Ruth says he is going to sea in a few days.&nbsp; When he comes back,
she will not be here.&nbsp; We will send her to Aunt Clara&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
And, besides, a year in the East, with the change in climate, people,
ideas, and everything, is just the thing she needs.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p>The desire to write was stirring in Martin once more.&nbsp; Stories
and poems were springing into spontaneous creation in his brain, and
he made notes of them against the future time when he would give them
expression.&nbsp; But he did not write.&nbsp; This was his little vacation;
he had resolved to devote it to rest and love, and in both matters he
prospered.&nbsp; He was soon spilling over with vitality, and each day
he saw Ruth, at the moment of meeting, she experienced the old shock
of his strength and health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; her mother warned her once again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am afraid you are seeing too much of Martin Eden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ruth laughed from security.&nbsp; She was sure of herself, and
in a few days he would be off to sea.&nbsp; Then, by the time he returned,
she would be away on her visit East.&nbsp; There was a magic, however,
in the strength and health of Martin.&nbsp; He, too, had been told of
her contemplated Eastern trip, and he felt the need for haste.&nbsp;
Yet he did not know how to make love to a girl like Ruth.&nbsp; Then,
too, he was handicapped by the possession of a great fund of experience
with girls and women who had been absolutely different from her.&nbsp;
They had known about love and life and flirtation, while she knew nothing
about such things.&nbsp; Her prodigious innocence appalled him, freezing
on his lips all ardors of speech, and convincing him, in spite of himself,
of his own unworthiness.&nbsp; Also he was handicapped in another way.&nbsp;
He had himself never been in love before.&nbsp; He had liked women in
that turgid past of his, and been fascinated by some of them, but he
had not known what it was to love them.&nbsp; He had whistled in a masterful,
careless way, and they had come to him.&nbsp; They had been diversions,
incidents, part of the game men play, but a small part at most.&nbsp;
And now, and for the first time, he was a suppliant, tender and timid
and doubting.&nbsp; He did not know the way of love, nor its speech,
while he was frightened at his loved one&rsquo;s clear innocence.</p>
<p>In the course of getting acquainted with a varied world, whirling
on through the ever changing phases of it, he had learned a rule of
conduct which was to the effect that when one played a strange game,
he should let the other fellow play first.&nbsp; This had stood him
in good stead a thousand times and trained him as an observer as well.&nbsp;
He knew how to watch the thing that was strange, and to wait for a weakness,
for a place of entrance, to divulge itself.&nbsp; It was like sparring
for an opening in fist-fighting.&nbsp; And when such an opening came,
he knew by long experience to play for it and to play hard.</p>
<p>So he waited with Ruth and watched, desiring to speak his love but
not daring.&nbsp; He was afraid of shocking her, and he was not sure
of himself.&nbsp; Had he but known it, he was following the right course
with her.&nbsp; Love came into the world before articulate speech, and
in its own early youth it had learned ways and means that it had never
forgotten.&nbsp; It was in this old, primitive way that Martin wooed
Ruth.&nbsp; He did not know he was doing it at first, though later he
divined it.&nbsp; The touch of his hand on hers was vastly more potent
than any word he could utter, the impact of his strength on her imagination
was more alluring than the printed poems and spoken passions of a thousand
generations of lovers.&nbsp; Whatever his tongue could express would
have appealed, in part, to her judgment; but the touch of hand, the
fleeting contact, made its way directly to her instinct.&nbsp; Her judgment
was as young as she, but her instincts were as old as the race and older.&nbsp;
They had been young when love was young, and they were wiser than convention
and opinion and all the new-born things.&nbsp; So her judgment did not
act.&nbsp; There was no call upon it, and she did not realize the strength
of the appeal Martin made from moment to moment to her love-nature.&nbsp;
That he loved her, on the other hand, was as clear as day, and she consciously
delighted in beholding his love-manifestations&mdash;the glowing eyes
with their tender lights, the trembling hands, and the never failing
swarthy flush that flooded darkly under his sunburn.&nbsp; She even
went farther, in a timid way inciting him, but doing it so delicately
that he never suspected, and doing it half-consciously, so that she
scarcely suspected herself.&nbsp; She thrilled with these proofs of
her power that proclaimed her a woman, and she took an Eve-like delight
in tormenting him and playing upon him.</p>
<p>Tongue-tied by inexperience and by excess of ardor, wooing unwittingly
and awkwardly, Martin continued his approach by contact.&nbsp; The touch
of his hand was pleasant to her, and something deliciously more than
pleasant.&nbsp; Martin did not know it, but he did know that it was
not distasteful to her.&nbsp; Not that they touched hands often, save
at meeting and parting; but that in handling the bicycles, in strapping
on the books of verse they carried into the hills, and in conning the
pages of books side by side, there were opportunities for hand to stray
against hand.&nbsp; And there were opportunities, too, for her hair
to brush his cheek, and for shoulder to touch shoulder, as they leaned
together over the beauty of the books.&nbsp; She smiled to herself at
vagrant impulses which arose from nowhere and suggested that she rumple
his hair; while he desired greatly, when they tired of reading, to rest
his head in her lap and dream with closed eyes about the future that
was to be theirs.&nbsp; On Sunday picnics at Shellmound Park and Schuetzen
Park, in the past, he had rested his head on many laps, and, usually,
he had slept soundly and selfishly while the girls shaded his face from
the sun and looked down and loved him and wondered at his lordly carelessness
of their love.&nbsp; To rest his head in a girl&rsquo;s lap had been
the easiest thing in the world until now, and now he found Ruth&rsquo;s
lap inaccessible and impossible.&nbsp; Yet it was right here, in his
reticence, that the strength of his wooing lay.&nbsp; It was because
of this reticence that he never alarmed her.&nbsp; Herself fastidious
and timid, she never awakened to the perilous trend of their intercourse.&nbsp;
Subtly and unaware she grew toward him and closer to him, while he,
sensing the growing closeness, longed to dare but was afraid.</p>
<p>Once he dared, one afternoon, when he found her in the darkened living
room with a blinding headache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can do it any good,&rdquo; she had answered his inquiries.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And besides, I don&rsquo;t take headache powders.&nbsp; Doctor
Hall won&rsquo;t permit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can cure it, I think, and without drugs,&rdquo; was Martin&rsquo;s
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not sure, of course, but I&rsquo;d like to
try.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s simply massage.&nbsp; I learned the trick first
from the Japanese.&nbsp; They are a race of masseurs, you know.&nbsp;
Then I learned it all over again with variations from the Hawaiians.&nbsp;
They call it <i>lomi-lomi</i>.&nbsp; It can accomplish most of the things
drugs accomplish and a few things that drugs can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had his hands touched her head when she sighed deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so good,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She spoke once again, half an hour later, when she asked, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t
you tired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was perfunctory, and she knew what the answer would
be.&nbsp; Then she lost herself in drowsy contemplation of the soothing
balm of his strength: Life poured from the ends of his fingers, driving
the pain before it, or so it seemed to her, until with the easement
of pain, she fell asleep and he stole away.</p>
<p>She called him up by telephone that evening to thank him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I slept until dinner,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You cured
me completely, Mr. Eden, and I don&rsquo;t know how to thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was warm, and bungling of speech, and very happy, as he replied
to her, and there was dancing in his mind, throughout the telephone
conversation, the memory of Browning and of sickly Elizabeth Barrett.&nbsp;
What had been done could be done again, and he, Martin Eden, could do
it and would do it for Ruth Morse.&nbsp; He went back to his room and
to the volume of Spencer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sociology&rdquo; lying open
on the bed.&nbsp; But he could not read.&nbsp; Love tormented him and
overrode his will, so that, despite all determination, he found himself
at the little ink-stained table.&nbsp; The sonnet he composed that night
was the first of a love-cycle of fifty sonnets which was completed within
two months.&nbsp; He had the &ldquo;Love-sonnets from the Portuguese&rdquo;
in mind as he wrote, and he wrote under the best conditions for great
work, at a climacteric of living, in the throes of his own sweet love-madness.</p>
<p>The many hours he was not with Ruth he devoted to the &ldquo;Love-cycle,&rdquo;
to reading at home, or to the public reading-rooms, where he got more
closely in touch with the magazines of the day and the nature of their
policy and content.&nbsp; The hours he spent with Ruth were maddening
alike in promise and in inconclusiveness.&nbsp; It was a week after
he cured her headache that a moonlight sail on Lake Merritt was proposed
by Norman and seconded by Arthur and Olney.&nbsp; Martin was the only
one capable of handling a boat, and he was pressed into service.&nbsp;
Ruth sat near him in the stern, while the three young fellows lounged
amidships, deep in a wordy wrangle over &ldquo;frat&rdquo; affairs.</p>
<p>The moon had not yet risen, and Ruth, gazing into the starry vault
of the sky and exchanging no speech with Martin, experienced a sudden
feeling of loneliness.&nbsp; She glanced at him.&nbsp; A puff of wind
was heeling the boat over till the deck was awash, and he, one hand
on tiller and the other on main-sheet, was luffing slightly, at the
same time peering ahead to make out the near-lying north shore.&nbsp;
He was unaware of her gaze, and she watched him intently, speculating
fancifully about the strange warp of soul that led him, a young man
with signal powers, to fritter away his time on the writing of stories
and poems foredoomed to mediocrity and failure.</p>
<p>Her eyes wandered along the strong throat, dimly seen in the starlight,
and over the firm-poised head, and the old desire to lay her hands upon
his neck came back to her.&nbsp; The strength she abhorred attracted
her.&nbsp; Her feeling of loneliness became more pronounced, and she
felt tired.&nbsp; Her position on the heeling boat irked her, and she
remembered the headache he had cured and the soothing rest that resided
in him.&nbsp; He was sitting beside her, quite beside her, and the boat
seemed to tilt her toward him.&nbsp; Then arose in her the impulse to
lean against him, to rest herself against his strength&mdash;a vague,
half-formed impulse, which, even as she considered it, mastered her
and made her lean toward him.&nbsp; Or was it the heeling of the boat?&nbsp;
She did not know.&nbsp; She never knew.&nbsp; She knew only that she
was leaning against him and that the easement and soothing rest were
very good.&nbsp; Perhaps it had been the boat&rsquo;s fault, but she
made no effort to retrieve it.&nbsp; She leaned lightly against his
shoulder, but she leaned, and she continued to lean when he shifted
his position to make it more comfortable for her.</p>
<p>It was a madness, but she refused to consider the madness.&nbsp;
She was no longer herself but a woman, with a woman&rsquo;s clinging
need; and though she leaned ever so lightly, the need seemed satisfied.&nbsp;
She was no longer tired.&nbsp; Martin did not speak.&nbsp; Had he, the
spell would have been broken.&nbsp; But his reticence of love prolonged
it.&nbsp; He was dazed and dizzy.&nbsp; He could not understand what
was happening.&nbsp; It was too wonderful to be anything but a delirium.&nbsp;
He conquered a mad desire to let go sheet and tiller and to clasp her
in his arms.&nbsp; His intuition told him it was the wrong thing to
do, and he was glad that sheet and tiller kept his hands occupied and
fended off temptation.&nbsp; But he luffed the boat less delicately,
spilling the wind shamelessly from the sail so as to prolong the tack
to the north shore.&nbsp; The shore would compel him to go about, and
the contact would be broken.&nbsp; He sailed with skill, stopping way
on the boat without exciting the notice of the wranglers, and mentally
forgiving his hardest voyages in that they had made this marvellous
night possible, giving him mastery over sea and boat and wind so that
he could sail with her beside him, her dear weight against him on his
shoulder.</p>
<p>When the first light of the rising moon touched the sail, illuminating
the boat with pearly radiance, Ruth moved away from him.&nbsp; And,
even as she moved, she felt him move away.&nbsp; The impulse to avoid
detection was mutual.&nbsp; The episode was tacitly and secretly intimate.&nbsp;
She sat apart from him with burning cheeks, while the full force of
it came home to her.&nbsp; She had been guilty of something she would
not have her brothers see, nor Olney see.&nbsp; Why had she done it?&nbsp;
She had never done anything like it in her life, and yet she had been
moonlight-sailing with young men before.&nbsp; She had never desired
to do anything like it.&nbsp; She was overcome with shame and with the
mystery of her own burgeoning womanhood.&nbsp; She stole a glance at
Martin, who was busy putting the boat about on the other tack, and she
could have hated him for having made her do an immodest and shameful
thing.&nbsp; And he, of all men!&nbsp; Perhaps her mother was right,
and she was seeing too much of him.&nbsp; It would never happen again,
she resolved, and she would see less of him in the future.&nbsp; She
entertained a wild idea of explaining to him the first time they were
alone together, of lying to him, of mentioning casually the attack of
faintness that had overpowered her just before the moon came up.&nbsp;
Then she remembered how they had drawn mutually away before the revealing
moon, and she knew he would know it for a lie.</p>
<p>In the days that swiftly followed she was no longer herself but a
strange, puzzling creature, wilful over judgment and scornful of self-analysis,
refusing to peer into the future or to think about herself and whither
she was drifting.&nbsp; She was in a fever of tingling mystery, alternately
frightened and charmed, and in constant bewilderment.&nbsp; She had
one idea firmly fixed, however, which insured her security.&nbsp; She
would not let Martin speak his love.&nbsp; As long as she did this,
all would be well.&nbsp; In a few days he would be off to sea.&nbsp;
And even if he did speak, all would be well.&nbsp; It could not be otherwise,
for she did not love him.&nbsp; Of course, it would be a painful half
hour for him, and an embarrassing half hour for her, because it would
be her first proposal.&nbsp; She thrilled deliciously at the thought.&nbsp;
She was really a woman, with a man ripe to ask for her in marriage.&nbsp;
It was a lure to all that was fundamental in her sex.&nbsp; The fabric
of her life, of all that constituted her, quivered and grew tremulous.&nbsp;
The thought fluttered in her mind like a flame-attracted moth.&nbsp;
She went so far as to imagine Martin proposing, herself putting the
words into his mouth; and she rehearsed her refusal, tempering it with
kindness and exhorting him to true and noble manhood.&nbsp; And especially
he must stop smoking cigarettes.&nbsp; She would make a point of that.&nbsp;
But no, she must not let him speak at all.&nbsp; She could stop him,
and she had told her mother that she would.&nbsp; All flushed and burning,
she regretfully dismissed the conjured situation.&nbsp; Her first proposal
would have to be deferred to a more propitious time and a more eligible
suitor.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p>Came a beautiful fall day, warm and languid, palpitant with the hush
of the changing season, a California Indian summer day, with hazy sun
and wandering wisps of breeze that did not stir the slumber of the air.&nbsp;
Filmy purple mists, that were not vapors but fabrics woven of color,
hid in the recesses of the hills.&nbsp; San Francisco lay like a blur
of smoke upon her heights.&nbsp; The intervening bay was a dull sheen
of molten metal, whereon sailing craft lay motionless or drifted with
the lazy tide.&nbsp; Far Tamalpais, barely seen in the silver haze,
bulked hugely by the Golden Gate, the latter a pale gold pathway under
the westering sun.&nbsp; Beyond, the Pacific, dim and vast, was raising
on its sky-line tumbled cloud-masses that swept landward, giving warning
of the first blustering breath of winter.</p>
<p>The erasure of summer was at hand.&nbsp; Yet summer lingered, fading
and fainting among her hills, deepening the purple of her valleys, spinning
a shroud of haze from waning powers and sated raptures, dying with the
calm content of having lived and lived well.&nbsp; And among the hills,
on their favorite knoll, Martin and Ruth sat side by side, their heads
bent over the same pages, he reading aloud from the love-sonnets of
the woman who had loved Browning as it is given to few men to be loved.</p>
<p>But the reading languished.&nbsp; The spell of passing beauty all
about them was too strong.&nbsp; The golden year was dying as it had
lived, a beautiful and unrepentant voluptuary, and reminiscent rapture
and content freighted heavily the air.&nbsp; It entered into them, dreamy
and languorous, weakening the fibres of resolution, suffusing the face
of morality, or of judgment, with haze and purple mist.&nbsp; Martin
felt tender and melting, and from time to time warm glows passed over
him.&nbsp; His head was very near to hers, and when wandering phantoms
of breeze stirred her hair so that it touched his face, the printed
pages swam before his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you know a word of what you are reading,&rdquo;
she said once when he had lost his place.</p>
<p>He looked at her with burning eyes, and was on the verge of becoming
awkward, when a retort came to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you know either.&nbsp; What was the
last sonnet about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she laughed frankly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
already forgotten.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let us read any more.&nbsp; The
day is too beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be our last in the hills for some time,&rdquo; he
announced gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a storm gathering out
there on the sea-rim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The book slipped from his hands to the ground, and they sat idly
and silently, gazing out over the dreamy bay with eyes that dreamed
and did not see.&nbsp; Ruth glanced sidewise at his neck.&nbsp; She
did not lean toward him.&nbsp; She was drawn by some force outside of
herself and stronger than gravitation, strong as destiny.&nbsp; It was
only an inch to lean, and it was accomplished without volition on her
part.&nbsp; Her shoulder touched his as lightly as a butterfly touches
a flower, and just as lightly was the counter-pressure.&nbsp; She felt
his shoulder press hers, and a tremor run through him.&nbsp; Then was
the time for her to draw back.&nbsp; But she had become an automaton.&nbsp;
Her actions had passed beyond the control of her will&mdash;she never
thought of control or will in the delicious madness that was upon her.&nbsp;
His arm began to steal behind her and around her.&nbsp; She waited its
slow progress in a torment of delight.&nbsp; She waited, she knew not
for what, panting, with dry, burning lips, a leaping pulse, and a fever
of expectancy in all her blood.&nbsp; The girdling arm lifted higher
and drew her toward him, drew her slowly and caressingly.&nbsp; She
could wait no longer.&nbsp; With a tired sigh, and with an impulsive
movement all her own, unpremeditated, spasmodic, she rested her head
upon his breast.&nbsp; His head bent over swiftly, and, as his lips
approached, hers flew to meet them.</p>
<p>This must be love, she thought, in the one rational moment that was
vouchsafed her.&nbsp; If it was not love, it was too shameful.&nbsp;
It could be nothing else than love.&nbsp; She loved the man whose arms
were around her and whose lips were pressed to hers.&nbsp; She pressed
more, tightly to him, with a snuggling movement of her body.&nbsp; And
a moment later, tearing herself half out of his embrace, suddenly and
exultantly she reached up and placed both hands upon Martin Eden&rsquo;s
sunburnt neck.&nbsp; So exquisite was the pang of love and desire fulfilled
that she uttered a low moan, relaxed her hands, and lay half-swooning
in his arms.</p>
<p>Not a word had been spoken, and not a word was spoken for a long
time.&nbsp; Twice he bent and kissed her, and each time her lips met
his shyly and her body made its happy, nestling movement.&nbsp; She
clung to him, unable to release herself, and he sat, half supporting
her in his arms, as he gazed with unseeing eyes at the blur of the great
city across the bay.&nbsp; For once there were no visions in his brain.&nbsp;
Only colors and lights and glows pulsed there, warm as the day and warm
as his love.&nbsp; He bent over her.&nbsp; She was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you love me?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the first, the very first, the first moment I laid eye
on you.&nbsp; I was mad for love of you then, and in all the time that
has passed since then I have only grown the madder.&nbsp; I am maddest,
now, dear.&nbsp; I am almost a lunatic, my head is so turned with joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad I am a woman, Martin&mdash;dear,&rdquo; she said,
after a long sigh.</p>
<p>He crushed her in his arms again and again, and then asked:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&nbsp; When did you first know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I knew it all the time, almost, from the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have been as blind as a bat!&rdquo; he cried, a ring
of vexation in his voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never dreamed it until just
how, when I&mdash;when I kissed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo;&nbsp; She drew herself partly
away and looked at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I meant I knew you loved almost
from the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came to me suddenly.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was speaking very
slowly, her eyes warm and fluttery and melting, a soft flush on her
cheeks that did not go away.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never knew until just now
when&mdash;you put your arms around me.&nbsp; And I never expected to
marry you, Martin, not until just now.&nbsp; How did you make me love
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;unless just
by loving you, for I loved you hard enough to melt the heart of a stone,
much less the heart of the living, breathing woman you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is so different from what I thought love would be,&rdquo;
she announced irrelevantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think it would be like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would be like this.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
was looking into his eyes at the moment, but her own dropped as she
continued, &ldquo;You see, I didn&rsquo;t know what this was like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He offered to draw her toward him again, but it was no more than
a tentative muscular movement of the girdling arm, for he feared that
he might be greedy.&nbsp; Then he felt her body yielding, and once again
she was close in his arms and lips were pressed on lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will my people say?&rdquo; she queried, with sudden apprehension,
in one of the pauses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; We can find out very easily any
time we are so minded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if mamma objects?&nbsp; I am sure I am afraid to tell
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell her,&rdquo; he volunteered valiantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
think your mother does not like me, but I can win her around.&nbsp;
A fellow who can win you can win anything.&nbsp; And if we don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ll have each other.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s
no danger not winning your mother to our marriage.&nbsp; She loves you
too well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not like to break her heart,&rdquo; Ruth said pensively.</p>
<p>He felt like assuring her that mothers&rsquo; hearts were not so
easily broken, but instead he said, &ldquo;And love is the greatest
thing in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Martin, you sometimes frighten me.&nbsp; I am
frightened now, when I think of you and of what you have been.&nbsp;
You must be very, very good to me.&nbsp; Remember, after all, that I
am only a child.&nbsp; I never loved before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I.&nbsp; We are both children together.&nbsp; And we are
fortunate above most, for we have found our first love in each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is impossible!&rdquo; she cried, withdrawing herself
from his arms with a swift, passionate movement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Impossible
for you.&nbsp; You have been a sailor, and sailors, I have heard, are&mdash;are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice faltered and died away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are addicted to having a wife in every port?&rdquo; he suggested.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is that what you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is not love.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke authoritatively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have been in many ports, but I never knew a passing touch of
love until I saw you that first night.&nbsp; Do you know, when I said
good night and went away, I was almost arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; The policeman thought I was drunk; and I was, too&mdash;with
love for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said we were children, and I said it was impossible,
for you, and we have strayed away from the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said that I never loved anybody but you,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are my first, my very first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you have been a sailor,&rdquo; she objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t prevent me from loving you the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there have been women&mdash;other women&mdash;oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to Martin Eden&rsquo;s supreme surprise, she burst into a storm
of tears that took more kisses than one and many caresses to drive away.&nbsp;
And all the while there was running through his head Kipling&rsquo;s
line: &ldquo;<i>And the Colonel&rsquo;s lady and Judy O&rsquo;Grady
are sisters under their skins</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was true, he decided;
though the novels he had read had led him to believe otherwise.&nbsp;
His idea, for which the novels were responsible, had been that only
formal proposals obtained in the upper classes.&nbsp; It was all right
enough, down whence he had come, for youths and maidens to win each
other by contact; but for the exalted personages up above on the heights
to make love in similar fashion had seemed unthinkable.&nbsp; Yet the
novels were wrong.&nbsp; Here was a proof of it.&nbsp; The same pressures
and caresses, unaccompanied by speech, that were efficacious with the
girls of the working-class, were equally efficacious with the girls
above the working-class.&nbsp; They were all of the same flesh, after
all, sisters under their skins; and he might have known as much himself
had he remembered his Spencer.&nbsp; As he held Ruth in his arms and
soothed her, he took great consolation in the thought that the Colonel&rsquo;s
lady and Judy O&rsquo;Grady were pretty much alike under their skins.&nbsp;
It brought Ruth closer to him, made her possible.&nbsp; Her dear flesh
was as anybody&rsquo;s flesh, as his flesh.&nbsp; There was no bar to
their marriage.&nbsp; Class difference was the only difference, and
class was extrinsic.&nbsp; It could be shaken off.&nbsp; A slave, he
had read, had risen to the Roman purple.&nbsp; That being so, then he
could rise to Ruth.&nbsp; Under her purity, and saintliness, and culture,
and ethereal beauty of soul, she was, in things fundamentally human,
just like Lizzie Connolly and all Lizzie Connollys.&nbsp; All that was
possible of them was possible of her.&nbsp; She could love, and hate,
maybe have hysterics; and she could certainly be jealous, as she was
jealous now, uttering her last sobs in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, I am older than you,&rdquo; she remarked suddenly,
opening her eyes and looking up at him, &ldquo;three years older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, you are only a child, and I am forty years older than
you, in experience,&rdquo; was his answer.</p>
<p>In truth, they were children together, so far as love was concerned,
and they were as naive and immature in the expression of their love
as a pair of children, and this despite the fact that she was crammed
with a university education and that his head was full of scientific
philosophy and the hard facts of life.</p>
<p>They sat on through the passing glory of the day, talking as lovers
are prone to talk, marvelling at the wonder of love and at destiny that
had flung them so strangely together, and dogmatically believing that
they loved to a degree never attained by lovers before.&nbsp; And they
returned insistently, again and again, to a rehearsal of their first
impressions of each other and to hopeless attempts to analyze just precisely
what they felt for each other and how much there was of it.</p>
<p>The cloud-masses on the western horizon received the descending sun,
and the circle of the sky turned to rose, while the zenith glowed with
the same warm color.&nbsp; The rosy light was all about them, flooding
over them, as she sang, &ldquo;Good-by, Sweet Day.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
sang softly, leaning in the cradle of his arm, her hands in his, their
hearts in each other&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p>Mrs. Morse did not require a mother&rsquo;s intuition to read the
advertisement in Ruth&rsquo;s face when she returned home.&nbsp; The
flush that would not leave the cheeks told the simple story, and more
eloquently did the eyes, large and bright, reflecting an unmistakable
inward glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; Mrs. Morse asked, having bided her
time till Ruth had gone to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know?&rdquo; Ruth queried, with trembling lips.</p>
<p>For reply, her mother&rsquo;s arm went around her, and a hand was
softly caressing her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not speak,&rdquo; she blurted out.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did
not intend that it should happen, and I would never have let him speak&mdash;only
he didn&rsquo;t speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he did not speak, then nothing could have happened,
could it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it did, just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of goodness, child, what are you babbling about?&rdquo;
Mrs. Morse was bewildered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I know what
happened, after all.&nbsp; What did happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth looked at her mother in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you knew.&nbsp; Why, we&rsquo;re engaged, Martin
and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morse laughed with incredulous vexation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t speak,&rdquo; Ruth explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
just loved me, that was all.&nbsp; I was as surprised as you are.&nbsp;
He didn&rsquo;t say a word.&nbsp; He just put his arm around me.&nbsp;
And&mdash;and I was not myself.&nbsp; And he kissed me, and I kissed
him.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; I just had to.&nbsp; And
then I knew I loved him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, waiting with expectancy the benediction of her mother&rsquo;s
kiss, but Mrs. Morse was coldly silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a dreadful accident, I know,&rdquo; Ruth recommenced
with a sinking voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know how you will
ever forgive me.&nbsp; But I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; I did not
dream that I loved him until that moment.&nbsp; And you must tell father
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it not be better not to tell your father?&nbsp; Let
me see Martin Eden, and talk with him, and explain.&nbsp; He will understand
and release you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; Ruth cried, starting up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do
not want to be released.&nbsp; I love him, and love is very sweet.&nbsp;
I am going to marry him&mdash;of course, if you will let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have other plans for you, Ruth, dear, your father and I&mdash;oh,
no, no; no man picked out for you, or anything like that.&nbsp; Our
plans go no farther than your marrying some man in your own station
in life, a good and honorable gentleman, whom you will select yourself,
when you love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I love Martin already,&rdquo; was the plaintive protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would not influence your choice in any way; but you are
our daughter, and we could not bear to see you make a marriage such
as this.&nbsp; He has nothing but roughness and coarseness to offer
you in exchange for all that is refined and delicate in you.&nbsp; He
is no match for you in any way.&nbsp; He could not support you.&nbsp;
We have no foolish ideas about wealth, but comfort is another matter,
and our daughter should at least marry a man who can give her that&mdash;and
not a penniless adventurer, a sailor, a cowboy, a smuggler, and Heaven
knows what else, who, in addition to everything, is hare-brained and
irresponsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth was silent.&nbsp; Every word she recognized as true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wastes his time over his writing, trying to accomplish
what geniuses and rare men with college educations sometimes accomplish.&nbsp;
A man thinking of marriage should be preparing for marriage.&nbsp; But
not he.&nbsp; As I have said, and I know you agree with me, he is irresponsible.&nbsp;
And why should he not be?&nbsp; It is the way of sailors.&nbsp; He has
never learned to be economical or temperate.&nbsp; The spendthrift years
have marked him.&nbsp; It is not his fault, of course, but that does
not alter his nature.&nbsp; And have you thought of the years of licentiousness
he inevitably has lived?&nbsp; Have you thought of that, daughter?&nbsp;
You know what marriage means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth shuddered and clung close to her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ruth waited a long time for the
thought to frame itself.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it is terrible.&nbsp; It sickens
me to think of it.&nbsp; I told you it was a dreadful accident, my loving
him; but I can&rsquo;t help myself.&nbsp; Could you help loving father?&nbsp;
Then it is the same with me.&nbsp; There is something in me, in him&mdash;I
never knew it was there until to-day&mdash;but it is there, and it makes
me love him.&nbsp; I never thought to love him, but, you see, I do,&rdquo;
she concluded, a certain faint triumph in her voice.</p>
<p>They talked long, and to little purpose, in conclusion agreeing to
wait an indeterminate time without doing anything.</p>
<p>The same conclusion was reached, a little later that night, between
Mrs. Morse and her husband, after she had made due confession of the
miscarriage of her plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could hardly have come otherwise,&rdquo; was Mr. Morse&rsquo;s
judgment.&nbsp; &ldquo;This sailor-fellow has been the only man she
was in touch with.&nbsp; Sooner or later she was going to awaken anyway;
and she did awaken, and lo! here was this sailor-fellow, the only accessible
man at the moment, and of course she promptly loved him, or thought
she did, which amounts to the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morse took it upon herself to work slowly and indirectly upon
Ruth, rather than to combat her.&nbsp; There would be plenty of time
for this, for Martin was not in position to marry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her see all she wants of him,&rdquo; was Mr. Morse&rsquo;s
advice.&nbsp; &ldquo;The more she knows him, the less she&rsquo;ll love
him, I wager.&nbsp; And give her plenty of contrast.&nbsp; Make a point
of having young people at the house.&nbsp; Young women and young men,
all sorts of young men, clever men, men who have done something or who
are doing things, men of her own class, gentlemen.&nbsp; She can gauge
him by them.&nbsp; They will show him up for what he is.&nbsp; And after
all, he is a mere boy of twenty-one.&nbsp; Ruth is no more than a child.&nbsp;
It is calf love with the pair of them, and they will grow out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the matter rested.&nbsp; Within the family it was accepted that
Ruth and Martin were engaged, but no announcement was made.&nbsp; The
family did not think it would ever be necessary.&nbsp; Also, it was
tacitly understood that it was to be a long engagement.&nbsp; They did
not ask Martin to go to work, nor to cease writing.&nbsp; They did not
intend to encourage him to mend himself.&nbsp; And he aided and abetted
them in their unfriendly designs, for going to work was farthest from
his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;ll like what I have done!&rdquo; he
said to Ruth several days later.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided that
boarding with my sister is too expensive, and I am going to board myself.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve rented a little room out in North Oakland, retired neighborhood
and all the rest, you know, and I&rsquo;ve bought an oil-burner on which
to cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth was overjoyed.&nbsp; The oil-burner especially pleased her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the way Mr. Butler began his start,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Martin frowned inwardly at the citation of that worthy gentleman,
and went on: &ldquo;I put stamps on all my manuscripts and started them
off to the editors again.&nbsp; Then to-day I moved in, and to-morrow
I start to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A position!&rdquo; she cried, betraying the gladness of her
surprise in all her body, nestling closer to him, pressing his hand,
smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you never told me!&nbsp; What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant that I was going to work at my writing.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Her face fell, and he went on hastily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misjudge
me.&nbsp; I am not going in this time with any iridescent ideas.&nbsp;
It is to be a cold, prosaic, matter-of-fact business proposition.&nbsp;
It is better than going to sea again, and I shall earn more money than
any position in Oakland can bring an unskilled man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, this vacation I have taken has given me perspective.&nbsp;
I haven&rsquo;t been working the life out of my body, and I haven&rsquo;t
been writing, at least not for publication.&nbsp; All I&rsquo;ve done
has been to love you and to think.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve read some, too,
but it has been part of my thinking, and I have read principally magazines.&nbsp;
I have generalized about myself, and the world, my place in it, and
my chance to win to a place that will be fit for you.&nbsp; Also, I&rsquo;ve
been reading Spencer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Philosophy of Style,&rsquo; and
found out a lot of what was the matter with me&mdash;or my writing,
rather; and for that matter with most of the writing that is published
every month in the magazines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the upshot of it all&mdash;of my thinking and reading
and loving&mdash;is that I am going to move to Grub Street.&nbsp; I
shall leave masterpieces alone and do hack-work&mdash;jokes, paragraphs,
feature articles, humorous verse, and society verse&mdash;all the rot
for which there seems so much demand.&nbsp; Then there are the newspaper
syndicates, and the newspaper short-story syndicates, and the syndicates
for the Sunday supplements.&nbsp; I can go ahead and hammer out the
stuff they want, and earn the equivalent of a good salary by it.&nbsp;
There are free-lances, you know, who earn as much as four or five hundred
a month.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care to become as they; but I&rsquo;ll
earn a good living, and have plenty of time to myself, which I wouldn&rsquo;t
have in any position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll have my spare time for study and for real
work.&nbsp; In between the grind I&rsquo;ll try my hand at masterpieces,
and I&rsquo;ll study and prepare myself for the writing of masterpieces.&nbsp;
Why, I am amazed at the distance I have come already.&nbsp; When I first
tried to write, I had nothing to write about except a few paltry experiences
which I neither understood nor appreciated.&nbsp; But I had no thoughts.&nbsp;
I really didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t even have the words with
which to think.&nbsp; My experiences were so many meaningless pictures.&nbsp;
But as I began to add to my knowledge, and to my vocabulary, I saw something
more in my experiences than mere pictures.&nbsp; I retained the pictures
and I found their interpretation.&nbsp; That was when I began to do
good work, when I wrote &lsquo;Adventure,&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Joy,&rsquo;
&lsquo;The Pot,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Wine of Life,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Jostling
Street,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Love-cycle,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Sea Lyrics.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I shall write more like them, and better; but I shall do it in my spare
time.&nbsp; My feet are on the solid earth, now.&nbsp; Hack-work and
income first, masterpieces afterward.&nbsp; Just to show you, I wrote
half a dozen jokes last night for the comic weeklies; and just as I
was going to bed, the thought struck me to try my hand at a triolet&mdash;a
humorous one; and inside an hour I had written four.&nbsp; They ought
to be worth a dollar apiece.&nbsp; Four dollars right there for a few
afterthoughts on the way to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s all valueless, just so much dull and
sordid plodding; but it is no more dull and sordid than keeping books
at sixty dollars a month, adding up endless columns of meaningless figures
until one dies.&nbsp; And furthermore, the hack-work keeps me in touch
with things literary and gives me time to try bigger things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what good are these bigger-things, these masterpieces?&rdquo;
Ruth demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I can,&rdquo; he began; but she interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All those you named, and which you say yourself are good&mdash;you
have not sold any of them.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t get married on masterpieces
that won&rsquo;t sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll get married on triolets that will sell,&rdquo;
he asserted stoutly, putting his arm around her and drawing a very unresponsive
sweetheart toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to this,&rdquo; he went on in attempted gayety.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not art, but it&rsquo;s a dollar.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He came in<br />
When I was out,<br />
To borrow some tin<br />
Was why he came in,<br />
And he went without;<br />
So I was in<br />
And he was out.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The merry lilt with which he had invested the jingle was at variance
with the dejection that came into his face as he finished.&nbsp; He
had drawn no smile from Ruth.&nbsp; She was looking at him in an earnest
and troubled way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be a dollar,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it is a jester&rsquo;s
dollar, the fee of a clown.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see, Martin, the whole
thing is lowering.&nbsp; I want the man I love and honor to be something
finer and higher than a perpetrator of jokes and doggerel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want him to be like&mdash;say Mr. Butler?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t like Mr. Butler,&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Butler&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he interrupted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only his indigestion I find fault with.&nbsp; But
to save me I can&rsquo;t see any difference between writing jokes or
comic verse and running a type-writer, taking dictation, or keeping
sets of books.&nbsp; It is all a means to an end.&nbsp; Your theory
is for me to begin with keeping books in order to become a successful
lawyer or man of business.&nbsp; Mine is to begin with hack-work and
develop into an able author.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a difference,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, your good work, what you yourself call good, you can&rsquo;t
sell.&nbsp; You have tried, you know that,&mdash;but the editors won&rsquo;t
buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me time, dear,&rdquo; he pleaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;The hack-work
is only makeshift, and I don&rsquo;t take it seriously.&nbsp; Give me
two years.&nbsp; I shall succeed in that time, and the editors will
be glad to buy my good work.&nbsp; I know what I am saying; I have faith
in myself.&nbsp; I know what I have in me; I know what literature is,
now; I know the average rot that is poured out by a lot of little men;
and I know that at the end of two years I shall be on the highroad to
success.&nbsp; As for business, I shall never succeed at it.&nbsp; I
am not in sympathy with it.&nbsp; It strikes me as dull, and stupid,
and mercenary, and tricky.&nbsp; Anyway I am not adapted for it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d never get beyond a clerkship, and how could you and I be happy
on the paltry earnings of a clerk?&nbsp; I want the best of everything
in the world for you, and the only time when I won&rsquo;t want it will
be when there is something better.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m going to get
it, going to get all of it.&nbsp; The income of a successful author
makes Mr. Butler look cheap.&nbsp; A &lsquo;best-seller&rsquo; will
earn anywhere between fifty and a hundred thousand dollars&mdash;sometimes
more and sometimes less; but, as a rule, pretty close to those figures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She remained silent; her disappointment was apparent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had hoped and planned otherwise.&nbsp; I had thought, and
I still think, that the best thing for you would be to study shorthand&mdash;you
already know type-writing&mdash;and go into father&rsquo;s office.&nbsp;
You have a good mind, and I am confident you would succeed as a lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<p>That Ruth had little faith in his power as a writer, did not alter
her nor diminish her in Martin&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; In the breathing
spell of the vacation he had taken, he had spent many hours in self-analysis,
and thereby learned much of himself.&nbsp; He had discovered that he
loved beauty more than fame, and that what desire he had for fame was
largely for Ruth&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; It was for this reason that his
desire for fame was strong.&nbsp; He wanted to be great in the world&rsquo;s
eyes; &ldquo;to make good,&rdquo; as he expressed it, in order that
the woman he loved should be proud of him and deem him worthy.</p>
<p>As for himself, he loved beauty passionately, and the joy of serving
her was to him sufficient wage.&nbsp; And more than beauty he loved
Ruth.&nbsp; He considered love the finest thing in the world.&nbsp;
It was love that had worked the revolution in him, changing him from
an uncouth sailor to a student and an artist; therefore, to him, the
finest and greatest of the three, greater than learning and artistry,
was love.&nbsp; Already he had discovered that his brain went beyond
Ruth&rsquo;s, just as it went beyond the brains of her brothers, or
the brain of her father.&nbsp; In spite of every advantage of university
training, and in the face of her bachelorship of arts, his power of
intellect overshadowed hers, and his year or so of self-study and equipment
gave him a mastery of the affairs of the world and art and life that
she could never hope to possess.</p>
<p>All this he realized, but it did not affect his love for her, nor
her love for him.&nbsp; Love was too fine and noble, and he was too
loyal a lover for him to besmirch love with criticism.&nbsp; What did
love have to do with Ruth&rsquo;s divergent views on art, right conduct,
the French Revolution, or equal suffrage?&nbsp; They were mental processes,
but love was beyond reason; it was superrational.&nbsp; He could not
belittle love.&nbsp; He worshipped it.&nbsp; Love lay on the mountain-tops
beyond the valley-land of reason.&nbsp; It was a sublimates condition
of existence, the topmost peak of living, and it came rarely.&nbsp;
Thanks to the school of scientific philosophers he favored, he knew
the biological significance of love; but by a refined process of the
same scientific reasoning he reached the conclusion that the human organism
achieved its highest purpose in love, that love must not be questioned,
but must be accepted as the highest guerdon of life.&nbsp; Thus, he
considered the lover blessed over all creatures, and it was a delight
to him to think of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s own mad lover,&rdquo; rising above
the things of earth, above wealth and judgment, public opinion and applause,
rising above life itself and &ldquo;dying on a kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much of this Martin had already reasoned out, and some of it he reasoned
out later.&nbsp; In the meantime he worked, taking no recreation except
when he went to see Ruth, and living like a Spartan.&nbsp; He paid two
dollars and a half a month rent for the small room he got from his Portuguese
landlady, Maria Silva, a virago and a widow, hard working and harsher
tempered, rearing her large brood of children somehow, and drowning
her sorrow and fatigue at irregular intervals in a gallon of the thin,
sour wine that she bought from the corner grocery and saloon for fifteen
cents.&nbsp; From detesting her and her foul tongue at first, Martin
grew to admire her as he observed the brave fight she made.&nbsp; There
were but four rooms in the little house&mdash;three, when Martin&rsquo;s
was subtracted.&nbsp; One of these, the parlor, gay with an ingrain
carpet and dolorous with a funeral card and a death-picture of one of
her numerous departed babes, was kept strictly for company.&nbsp; The
blinds were always down, and her barefooted tribe was never permitted
to enter the sacred precinct save on state occasions.&nbsp; She cooked,
and all ate, in the kitchen, where she likewise washed, starched, and
ironed clothes on all days of the week except Sunday; for her income
came largely from taking in washing from her more prosperous neighbors.&nbsp;
Remained the bedroom, small as the one occupied by Martin, into which
she and her seven little ones crowded and slept.&nbsp; It was an everlasting
miracle to Martin how it was accomplished, and from her side of the
thin partition he heard nightly every detail of the going to bed, the
squalls and squabbles, the soft chattering, and the sleepy, twittering
noises as of birds.&nbsp; Another source of income to Maria were her
cows, two of them, which she milked night and morning and which gained
a surreptitious livelihood from vacant lots and the grass that grew
on either side the public side walks, attended always by one or more
of her ragged boys, whose watchful guardianship consisted chiefly in
keeping their eyes out for the poundmen.</p>
<p>In his own small room Martin lived, slept, studied, wrote, and kept
house.&nbsp; Before the one window, looking out on the tiny front porch,
was the kitchen table that served as desk, library, and type-writing
stand.&nbsp; The bed, against the rear wall, occupied two-thirds of
the total space of the room.&nbsp; The table was flanked on one side
by a gaudy bureau, manufactured for profit and not for service, the
thin veneer of which was shed day by day.&nbsp; This bureau stood in
the corner, and in the opposite corner, on the table&rsquo;s other flank,
was the kitchen&mdash;the oil-stove on a dry-goods box, inside of which
were dishes and cooking utensils, a shelf on the wall for provisions,
and a bucket of water on the floor.&nbsp; Martin had to carry his water
from the kitchen sink, there being no tap in his room.&nbsp; On days
when there was much steam to his cooking, the harvest of veneer from
the bureau was unusually generous.&nbsp; Over the bed, hoisted by a
tackle to the ceiling, was his bicycle.&nbsp; At first he had tried
to keep it in the basement; but the tribe of Silva, loosening the bearings
and puncturing the tires, had driven him out.&nbsp; Next he attempted
the tiny front porch, until a howling southeaster drenched the wheel
a night-long.&nbsp; Then he had retreated with it to his room and slung
it aloft.</p>
<p>A small closet contained his clothes and the books he had accumulated
and for which there was no room on the table or under the table.&nbsp;
Hand in hand with reading, he had developed the habit of making notes,
and so copiously did he make them that there would have been no existence
for him in the confined quarters had he not rigged several clothes-lines
across the room on which the notes were hung.&nbsp; Even so, he was
crowded until navigating the room was a difficult task.&nbsp; He could
not open the door without first closing the closet door, and <i>vice
versa</i>.&nbsp; It was impossible for him anywhere to traverse the
room in a straight line.&nbsp; To go from the door to the head of the
bed was a zigzag course that he was never quite able to accomplish in
the dark without collisions.&nbsp; Having settled the difficulty of
the conflicting doors, he had to steer sharply to the right to avoid
the kitchen.&nbsp; Next, he sheered to the left, to escape the foot
of the bed; but this sheer, if too generous, brought him against the
corner of the table.&nbsp; With a sudden twitch and lurch, he terminated
the sheer and bore off to the right along a sort of canal, one bank
of which was the bed, the other the table.&nbsp; When the one chair
in the room was at its usual place before the table, the canal was unnavigable.&nbsp;
When the chair was not in use, it reposed on top of the bed, though
sometimes he sat on the chair when cooking, reading a book while the
water boiled, and even becoming skilful enough to manage a paragraph
or two while steak was frying.&nbsp; Also, so small was the little corner
that constituted the kitchen, he was able, sitting down, to reach anything
he needed.&nbsp; In fact, it was expedient to cook sitting down; standing
up, he was too often in his own way.</p>
<p>In conjunction with a perfect stomach that could digest anything,
he possessed knowledge of the various foods that were at the same time
nutritious and cheap.&nbsp; Pea-soup was a common article in his diet,
as well as potatoes and beans, the latter large and brown and cooked
in Mexican style.&nbsp; Rice, cooked as American housewives never cook
it and can never learn to cook it, appeared on Martin&rsquo;s table
at least once a day.&nbsp; Dried fruits were less expensive than fresh,
and he had usually a pot of them, cooked and ready at hand, for they
took the place of butter on his bread.&nbsp; Occasionally he graced
his table with a piece of round-steak, or with a soup-bone.&nbsp; Coffee,
without cream or milk, he had twice a day, in the evening substituting
tea; but both coffee and tea were excellently cooked.</p>
<p>There was need for him to be economical.&nbsp; His vacation had consumed
nearly all he had earned in the laundry, and he was so far from his
market that weeks must elapse before he could hope for the first returns
from his hack-work.&nbsp; Except at such times as he saw Ruth, or dropped
in to see his sister Gertude, he lived a recluse, in each day accomplishing
at least three days&rsquo; labor of ordinary men.&nbsp; He slept a scant
five hours, and only one with a constitution of iron could have held
himself down, as Martin did, day after day, to nineteen consecutive
hours of toil.&nbsp; He never lost a moment.&nbsp; On the looking-glass
were lists of definitions and pronunciations; when shaving, or dressing,
or combing his hair, he conned these lists over.&nbsp; Similar lists
were on the wall over the oil-stove, and they were similarly conned
while he was engaged in cooking or in washing the dishes.&nbsp; New
lists continually displaced the old ones.&nbsp; Every strange or partly
familiar word encountered in his reading was immediately jotted down,
and later, when a sufficient number had been accumulated, were typed
and pinned to the wall or looking-glass.&nbsp; He even carried them
in his pockets, and reviewed them at odd moments on the street, or while
waiting in butcher shop or grocery to be served.</p>
<p>He went farther in the matter.&nbsp; Reading the works of men who
had arrived, he noted every result achieved by them, and worked out
the tricks by which they had been achieved&mdash;the tricks of narrative,
of exposition, of style, the points of view, the contrasts, the epigrams;
and of all these he made lists for study.&nbsp; He did not ape.&nbsp;
He sought principles.&nbsp; He drew up lists of effective and fetching
mannerisms, till out of many such, culled from many writers, he was
able to induce the general principle of mannerism, and, thus equipped,
to cast about for new and original ones of his own, and to weigh and
measure and appraise them properly.&nbsp; In similar manner he collected
lists of strong phrases, the phrases of living language, phrases that
bit like acid and scorched like flame, or that glowed and were mellow
and luscious in the midst of the arid desert of common speech.&nbsp;
He sought always for the principle that lay behind and beneath.&nbsp;
He wanted to know how the thing was done; after that he could do it
for himself.&nbsp; He was not content with the fair face of beauty.&nbsp;
He dissected beauty in his crowded little bedroom laboratory, where
cooking smells alternated with the outer bedlam of the Silva tribe;
and, having dissected and learned the anatomy of beauty, he was nearer
being able to create beauty itself.</p>
<p>He was so made that he could work only with understanding.&nbsp;
He could not work blindly, in the dark, ignorant of what he was producing
and trusting to chance and the star of his genius that the effect produced
should be right and fine.&nbsp; He had no patience with chance effects.&nbsp;
He wanted to know why and how.&nbsp; His was deliberate creative genius,
and, before he began a story or poem, the thing itself was already alive
in his brain, with the end in sight and the means of realizing that
end in his conscious possession.&nbsp; Otherwise the effort was doomed
to failure.&nbsp; On the other hand, he appreciated the chance effects
in words and phrases that came lightly and easily into his brain, and
that later stood all tests of beauty and power and developed tremendous
and incommunicable connotations.&nbsp; Before such he bowed down and
marvelled, knowing that they were beyond the deliberate creation of
any man.&nbsp; And no matter how much he dissected beauty in search
of the principles that underlie beauty and make beauty possible, he
was aware, always, of the innermost mystery of beauty to which he did
not penetrate and to which no man had ever penetrated.&nbsp; He knew
full well, from his Spencer, that man can never attain ultimate knowledge
of anything, and that the mystery of beauty was no less than that of
life&mdash;nay, more that the fibres of beauty and life were intertwisted,
and that he himself was but a bit of the same nonunderstandable fabric,
twisted of sunshine and star-dust and wonder.</p>
<p>In fact, it was when filled with these thoughts that he wrote his
essay entitled &ldquo;Star-dust,&rdquo; in which he had his fling, not
at the principles of criticism, but at the principal critics.&nbsp;
It was brilliant, deep, philosophical, and deliciously touched with
laughter.&nbsp; Also it was promptly rejected by the magazines as often
as it was submitted.&nbsp; But having cleared his mind of it, he went
serenely on his way.&nbsp; It was a habit he developed, of incubating
and maturing his thought upon a subject, and of then rushing into the
type-writer with it.&nbsp; That it did not see print was a matter of
small moment with him.&nbsp; The writing of it was the culminating act
of a long mental process, the drawing together of scattered threads
of thought and the final generalizing upon all the data with which his
mind was burdened.&nbsp; To write such an article was the conscious
effort by which he freed his mind and made it ready for fresh material
and problems.&nbsp; It was in a way akin to that common habit of men
and women troubled by real or fancied grievances, who periodically and
volubly break their long-suffering silence and &ldquo;have their say&rdquo;
till the last word is said.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<p>The weeks passed.&nbsp; Martin ran out of money, and publishers&rsquo;
checks were far away as ever.&nbsp; All his important manuscripts had
come back and been started out again, and his hack-work fared no better.&nbsp;
His little kitchen was no longer graced with a variety of foods.&nbsp;
Caught in the pinch with a part sack of rice and a few pounds of dried
apricots, rice and apricots was his menu three times a day for five
days hand-running.&nbsp; Then he startled to realize on his credit.&nbsp;
The Portuguese grocer, to whom he had hitherto paid cash, called a halt
when Martin&rsquo;s bill reached the magnificent total of three dollars
and eighty-five cents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you see,&rdquo; said the grocer, &ldquo;you no catcha
da work, I losa da mon&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Martin could reply nothing.&nbsp; There was no way of explaining.&nbsp;
It was not true business principle to allow credit to a strong-bodied
young fellow of the working-class who was too lazy to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You catcha da job, I let you have mora da grub,&rdquo; the
grocer assured Martin.&nbsp; &ldquo;No job, no grub.&nbsp; Thata da
business.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, to show that it was purely business
foresight and not prejudice, &ldquo;Hava da drink on da house&mdash;good
friends justa da same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Martin drank, in his easy way, to show that he was good friends
with the house, and then went supperless to bed.</p>
<p>The fruit store, where Martin had bought his vegetables, was run
by an American whose business principles were so weak that he let Martin
run a bill of five dollars before stopping his credit.&nbsp; The baker
stopped at two dollars, and the butcher at four dollars.&nbsp; Martin
added his debts and found that he was possessed of a total credit in
all the world of fourteen dollars and eighty-five cents.&nbsp; He was
up with his type-writer rent, but he estimated that he could get two
months&rsquo; credit on that, which would be eight dollars.&nbsp; When
that occurred, he would have exhausted all possible credit.</p>
<p>The last purchase from the fruit store had been a sack of potatoes,
and for a week he had potatoes, and nothing but potatoes, three times
a day.&nbsp; An occasional dinner at Ruth&rsquo;s helped to keep strength
in his body, though he found it tantalizing enough to refuse further
helping when his appetite was raging at sight of so much food spread
before it.&nbsp; Now and again, though afflicted with secret shame,
he dropped in at his sister&rsquo;s at meal-time and ate as much as
he dared&mdash;more than he dared at the Morse table.</p>
<p>Day by day he worked on, and day by day the postman delivered to
him rejected manuscripts.&nbsp; He had no money for stamps, so the manuscripts
accumulated in a heap under the table.&nbsp; Came a day when for forty
hours he had not tasted food.&nbsp; He could not hope for a meal at
Ruth&rsquo;s, for she was away to San Rafael on a two weeks&rsquo; visit;
and for very shame&rsquo;s sake he could not go to his sister&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
To cap misfortune, the postman, in his afternoon round, brought him
five returned manuscripts.&nbsp; Then it was that Martin wore his overcoat
down into Oakland, and came back without it, but with five dollars tinkling
in his pocket.&nbsp; He paid a dollar each on account to the four tradesmen,
and in his kitchen fried steak and onions, made coffee, and stewed a
large pot of prunes.&nbsp; And having dined, he sat down at his table-desk
and completed before midnight an essay which he entitled &ldquo;The
Dignity of Usury.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having typed it out, he flung it under
the table, for there had been nothing left from the five dollars with
which to buy stamps.</p>
<p>Later on he pawned his watch, and still later his wheel, reducing
the amount available for food by putting stamps on all his manuscripts
and sending them out.&nbsp; He was disappointed with his hack-work.&nbsp;
Nobody cared to buy.&nbsp; He compared it with what he found in the
newspapers, weeklies, and cheap magazines, and decided that his was
better, far better, than the average; yet it would not sell.&nbsp; Then
he discovered that most of the newspapers printed a great deal of what
was called &ldquo;plate&rdquo; stuff, and he got the address of the
association that furnished it.&nbsp; His own work that he sent in was
returned, along with a stereotyped slip informing him that the staff
supplied all the copy that was needed.</p>
<p>In one of the great juvenile periodicals he noted whole columns of
incident and anecdote.&nbsp; Here was a chance.&nbsp; His paragraphs
were returned, and though he tried repeatedly he never succeeded in
placing one.&nbsp; Later on, when it no longer mattered, he learned
that the associate editors and sub-editors augmented their salaries
by supplying those paragraphs themselves.&nbsp; The comic weeklies returned
his jokes and humorous verse, and the light society verse he wrote for
the large magazines found no abiding-place.&nbsp; Then there was the
newspaper storiette.&nbsp; He knew that he could write better ones than
were published.&nbsp; Managing to obtain the addresses of two newspaper
syndicates, he deluged them with storiettes.&nbsp; When he had written
twenty and failed to place one of them, he ceased.&nbsp; And yet, from
day to day, he read storiettes in the dailies and weeklies, scores and
scores of storiettes, not one of which would compare with his.&nbsp;
In his despondency, he concluded that he had no judgment whatever, that
he was hypnotized by what he wrote, and that he was a self-deluded pretender.</p>
<p>The inhuman editorial machine ran smoothly as ever.&nbsp; He folded
the stamps in with his manuscript, dropped it into the letter-box, and
from three weeks to a month afterward the postman came up the steps
and handed him the manuscript.&nbsp; Surely there were no live, warm
editors at the other end.&nbsp; It was all wheels and cogs and oil-cups&mdash;a
clever mechanism operated by automatons.&nbsp; He reached stages of
despair wherein he doubted if editors existed at all.&nbsp; He had never
received a sign of the existence of one, and from absence of judgment
in rejecting all he wrote it seemed plausible that editors were myths,
manufactured and maintained by office boys, typesetters, and pressmen.</p>
<p>The hours he spent with Ruth were the only happy ones he had, and
they were not all happy.&nbsp; He was afflicted always with a gnawing
restlessness, more tantalizing than in the old days before he possessed
her love; for now that he did possess her love, the possession of her
was far away as ever.&nbsp; He had asked for two years; time was flying,
and he was achieving nothing.&nbsp; Again, he was always conscious of
the fact that she did not approve what he was doing.&nbsp; She did not
say so directly.&nbsp; Yet indirectly she let him understand it as clearly
and definitely as she could have spoken it.&nbsp; It was not resentment
with her, but disapproval; though less sweet-natured women might have
resented where she was no more than disappointed.&nbsp; Her disappointment
lay in that this man she had taken to mould, refused to be moulded.&nbsp;
To a certain extent she had found his clay plastic, then it had developed
stubbornness, declining to be shaped in the image of her father or of
Mr. Butler.</p>
<p>What was great and strong in him, she missed, or, worse yet, misunderstood.&nbsp;
This man, whose clay was so plastic that he could live in any number
of pigeonholes of human existence, she thought wilful and most obstinate
because she could not shape him to live in her pigeonhole, which was
the only one she knew.&nbsp; She could not follow the flights of his
mind, and when his brain got beyond her, she deemed him erratic.&nbsp;
Nobody else&rsquo;s brain ever got beyond her.&nbsp; She could always
follow her father and mother, her brothers and Olney; wherefore, when
she could not follow Martin, she believed the fault lay with him.&nbsp;
It was the old tragedy of insularity trying to serve as mentor to the
universal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You worship at the shrine of the established,&rdquo; he told
her once, in a discussion they had over Praps and Vanderwater.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I grant that as authorities to quote they are most excellent&mdash;the
two foremost literary critics in the United States.&nbsp; Every school
teacher in the land looks up to Vanderwater as the Dean of American
criticism.&nbsp; Yet I read his stuff, and it seems to me the perfection
of the felicitous expression of the inane.&nbsp; Why, he is no more
than a ponderous bromide, thanks to Gelett Burgess.&nbsp; And Praps
is no better.&nbsp; His &lsquo;Hemlock Mosses,&rsquo; for instance is
beautifully written.&nbsp; Not a comma is out of place; and the tone&mdash;ah!&mdash;is
lofty, so lofty.&nbsp; He is the best-paid critic in the United States.&nbsp;
Though, Heaven forbid! he&rsquo;s not a critic at all.&nbsp; They do
criticism better in England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the point is, they sound the popular note, and they sound
it so beautifully and morally and contentedly.&nbsp; Their reviews remind
me of a British Sunday.&nbsp; They are the popular mouthpieces.&nbsp;
They back up your professors of English, and your professors of English
back them up.&nbsp; And there isn&rsquo;t an original idea in any of
their skulls.&nbsp; They know only the established,&mdash;in fact, they
are the established.&nbsp; They are weak minded, and the established
impresses itself upon them as easily as the name of the brewery is impressed
on a beer bottle.&nbsp; And their function is to catch all the young
fellows attending the university, to drive out of their minds any glimmering
originality that may chance to be there, and to put upon them the stamp
of the established.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I am nearer the truth,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;when
I stand by the established, than you are, raging around like an iconoclastic
South Sea Islander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the missionary who did the image breaking,&rdquo; he
laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And unfortunately, all the missionaries are off
among the heathen, so there are none left at home to break those old
images, Mr. Vanderwater and Mr. Praps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the college professors, as well,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>He shook his head emphatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;No; the science professors
should live.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re really great.&nbsp; But it would be
a good deed to break the heads of nine-tenths of the English professors&mdash;little,
microscopic-minded parrots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was rather severe on the professors, but which to Ruth was
blasphemy.&nbsp; She could not help but measure the professors, neat,
scholarly, in fitting clothes, speaking in well-modulated voices, breathing
of culture and refinement, with this almost indescribable young fellow
whom somehow she loved, whose clothes never would fit him, whose heavy
muscles told of damning toil, who grew excited when he talked, substituting
abuse for calm statement and passionate utterance for cool self-possession.&nbsp;
They at least earned good salaries and were&mdash;yes, she compelled
herself to face it&mdash;were gentlemen; while he could not earn a penny,
and he was not as they.</p>
<p>She did not weigh Martin&rsquo;s words nor judge his argument by
them.&nbsp; Her conclusion that his argument was wrong was reached&mdash;unconsciously,
it is true&mdash;by a comparison of externals.&nbsp; They, the professors,
were right in their literary judgments because they were successes.&nbsp;
Martin&rsquo;s literary judgments were wrong because he could not sell
his wares.&nbsp; To use his own phrase, they made good, and he did not
make good.&nbsp; And besides, it did not seem reasonable that he should
be right&mdash;he who had stood, so short a time before, in that same
living room, blushing and awkward, acknowledging his introduction, looking
fearfully about him at the bric-a-brac his swinging shoulders threatened
to break, asking how long since Swinburne died, and boastfully announcing
that he had read &ldquo;Excelsior&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Psalm of Life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unwittingly, Ruth herself proved his point that she worshipped the
established.&nbsp; Martin followed the processes of her thoughts, but
forbore to go farther.&nbsp; He did not love her for what she thought
of Praps and Vanderwater and English professors, and he was coming to
realize, with increasing conviction, that he possessed brain-areas and
stretches of knowledge which she could never comprehend nor know existed.</p>
<p>In music she thought him unreasonable, and in the matter of opera
not only unreasonable but wilfully perverse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you like it?&rdquo; she asked him one night, on the
way home from the opera.</p>
<p>It was a night when he had taken her at the expense of a month&rsquo;s
rigid economizing on food.&nbsp; After vainly waiting for him to speak
about it, herself still tremulous and stirred by what she had just seen
and heard, she had asked the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked the overture,&rdquo; was his answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
was splendid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the opera itself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was splendid too; that is, the orchestra was, though
I&rsquo;d have enjoyed it more if those jumping-jacks had kept quiet
or gone off the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth was aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean Tetralani or Barillo?&rdquo; she queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of them&mdash;the whole kit and crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are great artists,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They spoiled the music just the same, with their antics and
unrealities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you like Barillo&rsquo;s voice?&rdquo; Ruth
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is next to Caruso, they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I liked him, and I liked Tetralani even better.&nbsp;
Her voice is exquisite&mdash;or at least I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, but&mdash;&rdquo; Ruth stammered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what you mean, then.&nbsp; You admire their voices, yet say they
spoiled the music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d give anything to hear them
in concert, and I&rsquo;d give even a bit more not to hear them when
the orchestra is playing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I am a hopeless realist.&nbsp;
Great singers are not great actors.&nbsp; To hear Barillo sing a love
passage with the voice of an angel, and to hear Tetralani reply like
another angel, and to hear it all accompanied by a perfect orgy of glowing
and colorful music&mdash;is ravishing, most ravishing.&nbsp; I do not
admit it.&nbsp; I assert it.&nbsp; But the whole effect is spoiled when
I look at them&mdash;at Tetralani, five feet ten in her stocking feet
and weighing a hundred and ninety pounds, and at Barillo, a scant five
feet four, greasy-featured, with the chest of a squat, undersized blacksmith,
and at the pair of them, attitudinizing, clasping their breasts, flinging
their arms in the air like demented creatures in an asylum; and when
I am expected to accept all this as the faithful illusion of a love-scene
between a slender and beautiful princess and a handsome, romantic, young
prince&mdash;why, I can&rsquo;t accept it, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
rot; it&rsquo;s absurd; it&rsquo;s unreal.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
the matter with it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not real.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell
me that anybody in this world ever made love that way.&nbsp; Why, if
I&rsquo;d made love to you in such fashion, you&rsquo;d have boxed my
ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you misunderstand,&rdquo; Ruth protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every
form of art has its limitations.&rdquo;&nbsp; (She was busy recalling
a lecture she had heard at the university on the conventions of the
arts.)&nbsp; &ldquo;In painting there are only two dimensions to the
canvas, yet you accept the illusion of three dimensions which the art
of a painter enables him to throw into the canvas.&nbsp; In writing,
again, the author must be omnipotent.&nbsp; You accept as perfectly
legitimate the author&rsquo;s account of the secret thoughts of the
heroine, and yet all the time you know that the heroine was alone when
thinking these thoughts, and that neither the author nor any one else
was capable of hearing them.&nbsp; And so with the stage, with sculpture,
with opera, with every art form.&nbsp; Certain irreconcilable things
must be accepted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understood that,&rdquo; Martin answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;All
the arts have their conventions.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Ruth was surprised at
his use of the word.&nbsp; It was as if he had studied at the university
himself, instead of being ill-equipped from browsing at haphazard through
the books in the library.)&nbsp; &ldquo;But even the conventions must
be real.&nbsp; Trees, painted on flat cardboard and stuck up on each
side of the stage, we accept as a forest.&nbsp; It is a real enough
convention.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, we would not accept a sea
scene as a forest.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; It violates our
senses.&nbsp; Nor would you, or, rather, should you, accept the ravings
and writhings and agonized contortions of those two lunatics to-night
as a convincing portrayal of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t hold yourself superior to all the judges
of music?&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not for a moment.&nbsp; I merely maintain my right
as an individual.&nbsp; I have just been telling you what I think, in
order to explain why the elephantine gambols of Madame Tetralani spoil
the orchestra for me.&nbsp; The world&rsquo;s judges of music may all
be right.&nbsp; But I am I, and I won&rsquo;t subordinate my taste to
the unanimous judgment of mankind.&nbsp; If I don&rsquo;t like a thing,
I don&rsquo;t like it, that&rsquo;s all; and there is no reason under
the sun why I should ape a liking for it just because the majority of
my fellow-creatures like it, or make believe they like it.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
follow the fashions in the things I like or dislike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But music, you know, is a matter of training,&rdquo; Ruth
argued; &ldquo;and opera is even more a matter of training.&nbsp; May
it not be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I am not trained in opera?&rdquo; he dashed in.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very thing,&rdquo; he agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I consider
I am fortunate in not having been caught when I was young.&nbsp; If
I had, I could have wept sentimental tears to-night, and the clownish
antics of that precious pair would have but enhanced the beauty of their
voices and the beauty of the accompanying orchestra.&nbsp; You are right.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s mostly a matter of training.&nbsp; And I am too old, now.&nbsp;
I must have the real or nothing.&nbsp; An illusion that won&rsquo;t
convince is a palpable lie, and that&rsquo;s what grand opera is to
me when little Barillo throws a fit, clutches mighty Tetralani in his
arms (also in a fit), and tells her how passionately he adores her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Ruth measured his thoughts by comparison of externals and in
accordance with her belief in the established.&nbsp; Who was he that
he should be right and all the cultured world wrong?&nbsp; His words
and thoughts made no impression upon her.&nbsp; She was too firmly intrenched
in the established to have any sympathy with revolutionary ideas.&nbsp;
She had always been used to music, and she had enjoyed opera ever since
she was a child, and all her world had enjoyed it, too.&nbsp; Then by
what right did Martin Eden emerge, as he had so recently emerged, from
his rag-time and working-class songs, and pass judgment on the world&rsquo;s
music?&nbsp; She was vexed with him, and as she walked beside him she
had a vague feeling of outrage.&nbsp; At the best, in her most charitable
frame of mind, she considered the statement of his views to be a caprice,
an erratic and uncalled-for prank.&nbsp; But when he took her in his
arms at the door and kissed her good night in tender lover-fashion,
she forgot everything in the outrush of her own love to him.&nbsp; And
later, on a sleepless pillow, she puzzled, as she had often puzzled
of late, as to how it was that she loved so strange a man, and loved
him despite the disapproval of her people.</p>
<p>And next day Martin Eden cast hack-work aside, and at white heat
hammered out an essay to which he gave the title, &ldquo;The Philosophy
of Illusion.&rdquo;&nbsp; A stamp started it on its travels, but it
was destined to receive many stamps and to be started on many travels
in the months that followed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<p>Maria Silva was poor, and all the ways of poverty were clear to her.&nbsp;
Poverty, to Ruth, was a word signifying a not-nice condition of existence.&nbsp;
That was her total knowledge on the subject.&nbsp; She knew Martin was
poor, and his condition she associated in her mind with the boyhood
of Abraham Lincoln, of Mr. Butler, and of other men who had become successes.&nbsp;
Also, while aware that poverty was anything but delectable, she had
a comfortable middle-class feeling that poverty was salutary, that it
was a sharp spur that urged on to success all men who were not degraded
and hopeless drudges.&nbsp; So that her knowledge that Martin was so
poor that he had pawned his watch and overcoat did not disturb her.&nbsp;
She even considered it the hopeful side of the situation, believing
that sooner or later it would arouse him and compel him to abandon his
writing.</p>
<p>Ruth never read hunger in Martin&rsquo;s face, which had grown lean
and had enlarged the slight hollows in the cheeks.&nbsp; In fact, she
marked the change in his face with satisfaction.&nbsp; It seemed to
refine him, to remove from him much of the dross of flesh and the too
animal-like vigor that lured her while she detested it.&nbsp; Sometimes,
when with her, she noted an unusual brightness in his eyes, and she
admired it, for it made him appear more the poet and the scholar&mdash;the
things he would have liked to be and which she would have liked him
to be.&nbsp; But Maria Silva read a different tale in the hollow cheeks
and the burning eyes, and she noted the changes in them from day to
day, by them following the ebb and flow of his fortunes.&nbsp; She saw
him leave the house with his overcoat and return without it, though
the day was chill and raw, and promptly she saw his cheeks fill out
slightly and the fire of hunger leave his eyes.&nbsp; In the same way
she had seen his wheel and watch go, and after each event she had seen
his vigor bloom again.</p>
<p>Likewise she watched his toils, and knew the measure of the midnight
oil he burned.&nbsp; Work!&nbsp; She knew that he outdid her, though
his work was of a different order.&nbsp; And she was surprised to behold
that the less food he had, the harder he worked.&nbsp; On occasion,
in a casual sort of way, when she thought hunger pinched hardest, she
would send him in a loaf of new baking, awkwardly covering the act with
banter to the effect that it was better than he could bake.&nbsp; And
again, she would send one of her toddlers in to him with a great pitcher
of hot soup, debating inwardly the while whether she was justified in
taking it from the mouths of her own flesh and blood.&nbsp; Nor was
Martin ungrateful, knowing as he did the lives of the poor, and that
if ever in the world there was charity, this was it.</p>
<p>On a day when she had filled her brood with what was left in the
house, Maria invested her last fifteen cents in a gallon of cheap wine.&nbsp;
Martin, coming into her kitchen to fetch water, was invited to sit down
and drink.&nbsp; He drank her very-good health, and in return she drank
his.&nbsp; Then she drank to prosperity in his undertakings, and he
drank to the hope that James Grant would show up and pay her for his
washing.&nbsp; James Grant was a journeymen carpenter who did not always
pay his bills and who owed Maria three dollars.</p>
<p>Both Maria and Martin drank the sour new wine on empty stomachs,
and it went swiftly to their heads.&nbsp; Utterly differentiated creatures
that they were, they were lonely in their misery, and though the misery
was tacitly ignored, it was the bond that drew them together.&nbsp;
Maria was amazed to learn that he had been in the Azores, where she
had lived until she was eleven.&nbsp; She was doubly amazed that he
had been in the Hawaiian Islands, whither she had migrated from the
Azores with her people.&nbsp; But her amazement passed all bounds when
he told her he had been on Maui, the particular island whereon she had
attained womanhood and married.&nbsp; Kahului, where she had first met
her husband,&mdash;he, Martin, had been there twice!&nbsp; Yes, she
remembered the sugar steamers, and he had been on them&mdash;well, well,
it was a small world.&nbsp; And Wailuku!&nbsp; That place, too!&nbsp;
Did he know the head-luna of the plantation?&nbsp; Yes, and had had
a couple of drinks with him.</p>
<p>And so they reminiscenced and drowned their hunger in the raw, sour
wine.&nbsp; To Martin the future did not seem so dim.&nbsp; Success
trembled just before him.&nbsp; He was on the verge of clasping it.&nbsp;
Then he studied the deep-lined face of the toil-worn woman before him,
remembered her soups and loaves of new baking, and felt spring up in
him the warmest gratitude and philanthropy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What would
you like to have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him, bepuzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you like to have now, right now, if you could get
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoe alla da roun&rsquo; for da childs&mdash;seven pairs da
shoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have them,&rdquo; he announced, while she nodded
her head gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I mean a big wish, something big
that you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes sparkled good-naturedly.&nbsp; He was choosing to make fun
with her, Maria, with whom few made fun these days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think hard,&rdquo; he cautioned, just as she was opening her
mouth to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alla right,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thinka da
hard.&nbsp; I lika da house, dis house&mdash;all mine, no paya da rent,
seven dollar da month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have it,&rdquo; he granted, &ldquo;and in a short
time.&nbsp; Now wish the great wish.&nbsp; Make believe I am God, and
I say to you anything you want you can have.&nbsp; Then you wish that
thing, and I listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria considered solemnly for a space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You no &rsquo;fraid?&rdquo; she asked warningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid.&nbsp;
Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most verra big,&rdquo; she warned again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; Fire away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, den&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She drew a big breath like a
child, as she voiced to the uttermost all she cared to demand of life.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I lika da have one milka ranch&mdash;good milka ranch.&nbsp;
Plenty cow, plenty land, plenty grass.&nbsp; I lika da have near San
Le-an; my sister liva dere.&nbsp; I sella da milk in Oakland.&nbsp;
I maka da plentee mon.&nbsp; Joe an&rsquo; Nick no runna da cow.&nbsp;
Dey go-a to school.&nbsp; Bimeby maka da good engineer, worka da railroad.&nbsp;
Yes, I lika da milka ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused and regarded Martin with twinkling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have it,&rdquo; he answered promptly.</p>
<p>She nodded her head and touched her lips courteously to the wine-glass
and to the giver of the gift she knew would never be given.&nbsp; His
heart was right, and in her own heart she appreciated his intention
as much as if the gift had gone with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Maria,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;Nick and Joe won&rsquo;t
have to peddle milk, and all the kids can go to school and wear shoes
the whole year round.&nbsp; It will be a first-class milk ranch&mdash;everything
complete.&nbsp; There will be a house to live in and a stable for the
horses, and cow-barns, of course.&nbsp; There will be chickens, pigs,
vegetables, fruit trees, and everything like that; and there will be
enough cows to pay for a hired man or two.&nbsp; Then you won&rsquo;t
have anything to do but take care of the children.&nbsp; For that matter,
if you find a good man, you can marry and take it easy while he runs
the ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And from such largess, dispensed from his future, Martin turned and
took his one good suit of clothes to the pawnshop.&nbsp; His plight
was desperate for him to do this, for it cut him off from Ruth.&nbsp;
He had no second-best suit that was presentable, and though he could
go to the butcher and the baker, and even on occasion to his sister&rsquo;s,
it was beyond all daring to dream of entering the Morse home so disreputably
apparelled.</p>
<p>He toiled on, miserable and well-nigh hopeless.&nbsp; It began to
appear to him that the second battle was lost and that he would have
to go to work.&nbsp; In doing this he would satisfy everybody&mdash;the
grocer, his sister, Ruth, and even Maria, to whom he owed a month&rsquo;s
room rent.&nbsp; He was two months behind with his type-writer, and
the agency was clamoring for payment or for the return of the machine.&nbsp;
In desperation, all but ready to surrender, to make a truce with fate
until he could get a fresh start, he took the civil service examinations
for the Railway Mail.&nbsp; To his surprise, he passed first.&nbsp;
The job was assured, though when the call would come to enter upon his
duties nobody knew.</p>
<p>It was at this time, at the lowest ebb, that the smooth-running editorial
machine broke down.&nbsp; A cog must have slipped or an oil-cup run
dry, for the postman brought him one morning a short, thin envelope.&nbsp;
Martin glanced at the upper left-hand corner and read the name and address
of the <i>Transcontinental Monthly</i>.&nbsp; His heart gave a great
leap, and he suddenly felt faint, the sinking feeling accompanied by
a strange trembling of the knees.&nbsp; He staggered into his room and
sat down on the bed, the envelope still unopened, and in that moment
came understanding to him how people suddenly fall dead upon receipt
of extraordinarily good news.</p>
<p>Of course this was good news.&nbsp; There was no manuscript in that
thin envelope, therefore it was an acceptance.&nbsp; He knew the story
in the hands of the <i>Transcontinental</i>.&nbsp; It was &ldquo;The
Ring of Bells,&rdquo; one of his horror stories, and it was an even
five thousand words.&nbsp; And, since first-class magazines always paid
on acceptance, there was a check inside.&nbsp; Two cents a word&mdash;twenty
dollars a thousand; the check must be a hundred dollars.&nbsp; One hundred
dollars!&nbsp; As he tore the envelope open, every item of all his debts
surged in his brain&mdash;$3.85 to the grocer; butcher $4.00 flat; baker,
$2.00; fruit store, $5.00; total, $14.85.&nbsp; Then there was room
rent, $2.50; another month in advance, $2.50; two months&rsquo; type-writer,
$8.00; a month in advance, $4.00; total, $31.85.&nbsp; And finally to
be added, his pledges, plus interest, with the pawnbroker&mdash;watch,
$5.50; overcoat, $5.50; wheel, $7.75; suit of clothes, $5.50 (60 % interest,
but what did it matter?)&mdash;grand total, $56.10.&nbsp; He saw, as
if visible in the air before him, in illuminated figures, the whole
sum, and the subtraction that followed and that gave a remainder of
$43.90.&nbsp; When he had squared every debt, redeemed every pledge,
he would still have jingling in his pockets a princely $43.90.&nbsp;
And on top of that he would have a month&rsquo;s rent paid in advance
on the type-writer and on the room.</p>
<p>By this time he had drawn the single sheet of type-written letter
out and spread it open.&nbsp; There was no check.&nbsp; He peered into
the envelope, held it to the light, but could not trust his eyes, and
in trembling haste tore the envelope apart.&nbsp; There was no check.&nbsp;
He read the letter, skimming it line by line, dashing through the editor&rsquo;s
praise of his story to the meat of the letter, the statement why the
check had not been sent.&nbsp; He found no such statement, but he did
find that which made him suddenly wilt.&nbsp; The letter slid from his
hand.&nbsp; His eyes went lack-lustre, and he lay back on the pillow,
pulling the blanket about him and up to his chin.</p>
<p>Five dollars for &ldquo;The Ring of Bells&rdquo;&mdash;five dollars
for five thousand words!&nbsp; Instead of two cents a word, ten words
for a cent!&nbsp; And the editor had praised it, too.&nbsp; And he would
receive the check when the story was published.&nbsp; Then it was all
poppycock, two cents a word for minimum rate and payment upon acceptance.&nbsp;
It was a lie, and it had led him astray.&nbsp; He would never have attempted
to write had he known that.&nbsp; He would have gone to work&mdash;to
work for Ruth.&nbsp; He went back to the day he first attempted to write,
and was appalled at the enormous waste of time&mdash;and all for ten
words for a cent.&nbsp; And the other high rewards of writers, that
he had read about, must be lies, too.&nbsp; His second-hand ideas of
authorship were wrong, for here was the proof of it.</p>
<p>The <i>Transcontinental</i> sold for twenty-five cents, and its dignified
and artistic cover proclaimed it as among the first-class magazines.&nbsp;
It was a staid, respectable magazine, and it had been published continuously
since long before he was born.&nbsp; Why, on the outside cover were
printed every month the words of one of the world&rsquo;s great writers,
words proclaiming the inspired mission of the <i>Transcontinental</i>
by a star of literature whose first coruscations had appeared inside
those self-same covers.&nbsp; And the high and lofty, heaven-inspired
<i>Transcontinental</i> paid five dollars for five thousand words!&nbsp;
The great writer had recently died in a foreign land&mdash;in dire poverty,
Martin remembered, which was not to be wondered at, considering the
magnificent pay authors receive.</p>
<p>Well, he had taken the bait, the newspaper lies about writers and
their pay, and he had wasted two years over it.&nbsp; But he would disgorge
the bait now.&nbsp; Not another line would he ever write.&nbsp; He would
do what Ruth wanted him to do, what everybody wanted him to do&mdash;get
a job.&nbsp; The thought of going to work reminded him of Joe&mdash;Joe,
tramping through the land of nothing-to-do.&nbsp; Martin heaved a great
sigh of envy.&nbsp; The reaction of nineteen hours a day for many days
was strong upon him.&nbsp; But then, Joe was not in love, had none of
the responsibilities of love, and he could afford to loaf through the
land of nothing-to-do.&nbsp; He, Martin, had something to work for,
and go to work he would.&nbsp; He would start out early next morning
to hunt a job.&nbsp; And he would let Ruth know, too, that he had mended
his ways and was willing to go into her father&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Five dollars for five thousand words, ten words for a cent, the market
price for art.&nbsp; The disappointment of it, the lie of it, the infamy
of it, were uppermost in his thoughts; and under his closed eyelids,
in fiery figures, burned the &ldquo;$3.85&rdquo; he owed the grocer.&nbsp;
He shivered, and was aware of an aching in his bones.&nbsp; The small
of his back ached especially.&nbsp; His head ached, the top of it ached,
the back of it ached, the brains inside of it ached and seemed to be
swelling, while the ache over his brows was intolerable.&nbsp; And beneath
the brows, planted under his lids, was the merciless &ldquo;$3.85.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He opened his eyes to escape it, but the white light of the room seemed
to sear the balls and forced him to close his eyes, when the &ldquo;$3.85&rdquo;
confronted him again.</p>
<p>Five dollars for five thousand words, ten words for a cent&mdash;that
particular thought took up its residence in his brain, and he could
no more escape it than he could the &ldquo;$3.85&rdquo; under his eyelids.&nbsp;
A change seemed to come over the latter, and he watched curiously, till
&ldquo;$2.00&rdquo; burned in its stead.&nbsp; Ah, he thought, that
was the baker.&nbsp; The next sum that appeared was &ldquo;$2.50.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It puzzled him, and he pondered it as if life and death hung on the
solution.&nbsp; He owed somebody two dollars and a half, that was certain,
but who was it?&nbsp; To find it was the task set him by an imperious
and malignant universe, and he wandered through the endless corridors
of his mind, opening all manner of lumber rooms and chambers stored
with odds and ends of memories and knowledge as he vainly sought the
answer.&nbsp; After several centuries it came to him, easily, without
effort, that it was Maria.&nbsp; With a great relief he turned his soul
to the screen of torment under his lids.&nbsp; He had solved the problem;
now he could rest.&nbsp; But no, the &ldquo;$2.50&rdquo; faded away,
and in its place burned &ldquo;$8.00.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who was that?&nbsp;
He must go the dreary round of his mind again and find out.</p>
<p>How long he was gone on this quest he did not know, but after what
seemed an enormous lapse of time, he was called back to himself by a
knock at the door, and by Maria&rsquo;s asking if he was sick.&nbsp;
He replied in a muffled voice he did not recognize, saying that he was
merely taking a nap.&nbsp; He was surprised when he noted the darkness
of night in the room.&nbsp; He had received the letter at two in the
afternoon, and he realized that he was sick.</p>
<p>Then the &ldquo;$8.00&rdquo; began to smoulder under his lids again,
and he returned himself to servitude.&nbsp; But he grew cunning.&nbsp;
There was no need for him to wander through his mind.&nbsp; He had been
a fool.&nbsp; He pulled a lever and made his mind revolve about him,
a monstrous wheel of fortune, a merry-go-round of memory, a revolving
sphere of wisdom.&nbsp; Faster and faster it revolved, until its vortex
sucked him in and he was flung whirling through black chaos.</p>
<p>Quite naturally he found himself at a mangle, feeding starched cuffs.&nbsp;
But as he fed he noticed figures printed in the cuffs.&nbsp; It was
a new way of marking linen, he thought, until, looking closer, he saw
&ldquo;$3.85&rdquo; on one of the cuffs.&nbsp; Then it came to him that
it was the grocer&rsquo;s bill, and that these were his bills flying
around on the drum of the mangle.&nbsp; A crafty idea came to him.&nbsp;
He would throw the bills on the floor and so escape paying them.&nbsp;
No sooner thought than done, and he crumpled the cuffs spitefully as
he flung them upon an unusually dirty floor.&nbsp; Ever the heap grew,
and though each bill was duplicated a thousand times, he found only
one for two dollars and a half, which was what he owed Maria.&nbsp;
That meant that Maria would not press for payment, and he resolved generously
that it would be the only one he would pay; so he began searching through
the cast-out heap for hers.&nbsp; He sought it desperately, for ages,
and was still searching when the manager of the hotel entered, the fat
Dutchman.&nbsp; His face blazed with wrath, and he shouted in stentorian
tones that echoed down the universe, &ldquo;I shall deduct the cost
of those cuffs from your wages!&rdquo;&nbsp; The pile of cuffs grew
into a mountain, and Martin knew that he was doomed to toil for a thousand
years to pay for them.&nbsp; Well, there was nothing left to do but
kill the manager and burn down the laundry.&nbsp; But the big Dutchman
frustrated him, seizing him by the nape of the neck and dancing him
up and down.&nbsp; He danced him over the ironing tables, the stove,
and the mangles, and out into the wash-room and over the wringer and
washer.&nbsp; Martin was danced until his teeth rattled and his head
ached, and he marvelled that the Dutchman was so strong.</p>
<p>And then he found himself before the mangle, this time receiving
the cuffs an editor of a magazine was feeding from the other side.&nbsp;
Each cuff was a check, and Martin went over them anxiously, in a fever
of expectation, but they were all blanks.&nbsp; He stood there and received
the blanks for a million years or so, never letting one go by for fear
it might be filled out.&nbsp; At last he found it.&nbsp; With trembling
fingers he held it to the light.&nbsp; It was for five dollars.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ha! Ha!&rdquo; laughed the editor across the mangle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
then, I shall kill you,&rdquo; Martin said.&nbsp; He went out into the
wash-room to get the axe, and found Joe starching manuscripts.&nbsp;
He tried to make him desist, then swung the axe for him.&nbsp; But the
weapon remained poised in mid-air, for Martin found himself back in
the ironing room in the midst of a snow-storm.&nbsp; No, it was not
snow that was falling, but checks of large denomination, the smallest
not less than a thousand dollars.&nbsp; He began to collect them and
sort them out, in packages of a hundred, tying each package securely
with twine.</p>
<p>He looked up from his task and saw Joe standing before him juggling
flat-irons, starched shirts, and manuscripts.&nbsp; Now and again he
reached out and added a bundle of checks to the flying miscellany that
soared through the roof and out of sight in a tremendous circle.&nbsp;
Martin struck at him, but he seized the axe and added it to the flying
circle.&nbsp; Then he plucked Martin and added him.&nbsp; Martin went
up through the roof, clutching at manuscripts, so that by the time he
came down he had a large armful.&nbsp; But no sooner down than up again,
and a second and a third time and countless times he flew around the
circle.&nbsp; From far off he could hear a childish treble singing:
&ldquo;Waltz me around again, Willie, around, around, around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He recovered the axe in the midst of the Milky Way of checks, starched
shirts, and manuscripts, and prepared, when he came down, to kill Joe.&nbsp;
But he did not come down.&nbsp; Instead, at two in the morning, Maria,
having heard his groans through the thin partition, came into his room,
to put hot flat-irons against his body and damp cloths upon his aching
eyes.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<p>Martin Eden did not go out to hunt for a job in the morning.&nbsp;
It was late afternoon before he came out of his delirium and gazed with
aching eyes about the room.&nbsp; Mary, one of the tribe of Silva, eight
years old, keeping watch, raised a screech at sight of his returning
consciousness.&nbsp; Maria hurried into the room from the kitchen.&nbsp;
She put her work-calloused hand upon his hot forehead and felt his pulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lika da eat?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He shook his head.&nbsp; Eating was farthest from his desire, and
he wondered that he should ever have been hungry in his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick, Maria,&rdquo; he said weakly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
is it?&nbsp; Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grip,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two or three days
you alla da right.&nbsp; Better you no eat now.&nbsp; Bimeby plenty
can eat, to-morrow can eat maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin was not used to sickness, and when Maria and her little girl
left him, he essayed to get up and dress.&nbsp; By a supreme exertion
of will, with rearing brain and eyes that ached so that he could not
keep them open, he managed to get out of bed, only to be left stranded
by his senses upon the table.&nbsp; Half an hour later he managed to
regain the bed, where he was content to lie with closed eyes and analyze
his various pains and weaknesses.&nbsp; Maria came in several times
to change the cold cloths on his forehead.&nbsp; Otherwise she left
him in peace, too wise to vex him with chatter.&nbsp; This moved him
to gratitude, and he murmured to himself, &ldquo;Maria, you getta da
milka ranch, all righta, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he remembered his long-buried past of yesterday.</p>
<p>It seemed a life-time since he had received that letter from the
<i>Transcontinental</i>, a life-time since it was all over and done
with and a new page turned.&nbsp; He had shot his bolt, and shot it
hard, and now he was down on his back.&nbsp; If he hadn&rsquo;t starved
himself, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been caught by La Grippe.&nbsp; He had
been run down, and he had not had the strength to throw off the germ
of disease which had invaded his system.&nbsp; This was what resulted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it profit a man to write a whole library and lose
his own life?&rdquo; he demanded aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is no place
for me.&nbsp; No more literature in mine.&nbsp; Me for the counting-house
and ledger, the monthly salary, and the little home with Ruth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two days later, having eaten an egg and two slices of toast and drunk
a cup of tea, he asked for his mail, but found his eyes still hurt too
much to permit him to read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You read for me, Maria,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never
mind the big, long letters.&nbsp; Throw them under the table.&nbsp;
Read me the small letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No can,&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Teresa, she go
to school, she can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Teresa Silva, aged nine, opened his letters and read them to him.&nbsp;
He listened absently to a long dun from the type-writer people, his
mind busy with ways and means of finding a job.&nbsp; Suddenly he was
shocked back to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We offer you forty dollars for all serial rights in
your story,&rsquo;&rdquo; Teresa slowly spelled out, &ldquo;&lsquo;provided
you allow us to make the alterations suggested.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What magazine is that?&rdquo; Martin shouted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,
give it to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could see to read, now, and he was unaware of the pain of the
action.&nbsp; It was the <i>White Mouse</i> that was offering him forty
dollars, and the story was &ldquo;The Whirlpool,&rdquo; another of his
early horror stories.&nbsp; He read the letter through again and again.&nbsp;
The editor told him plainly that he had not handled the idea properly,
but that it was the idea they were buying because it was original.&nbsp;
If they could cut the story down one-third, they would take it and send
him forty dollars on receipt of his answer.</p>
<p>He called for pen and ink, and told the editor he could cut the story
down three-thirds if he wanted to, and to send the forty dollars right
along.</p>
<p>The letter despatched to the letter-box by Teresa, Martin lay back
and thought.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t a lie, after all.&nbsp; The <i>White
Mouse</i> paid on acceptance.&nbsp; There were three thousand words
in &ldquo;The Whirlpool.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cut down a third, there would
be two thousand.&nbsp; At forty dollars that would be two cents a word.&nbsp;
Pay on acceptance and two cents a word&mdash;the newspapers had told
the truth.&nbsp; And he had thought the <i>White Mouse</i> a third-rater!&nbsp;
It was evident that he did not know the magazines.&nbsp; He had deemed
the <i>Transcontinental</i> a first-rater, and it paid a cent for ten
words.&nbsp; He had classed the <i>White Mouse</i> as of no account,
and it paid twenty times as much as the<i> Transcontinental</i> and
also had paid on acceptance.</p>
<p>Well, there was one thing certain: when he got well, he would not
go out looking for a job.&nbsp; There were more stories in his head
as good as &ldquo;The Whirlpool,&rdquo; and at forty dollars apiece
he could earn far more than in any job or position.&nbsp; Just when
he thought the battle lost, it was won.&nbsp; He had proved for his
career.&nbsp; The way was clear.&nbsp; Beginning with the <i>White Mouse</i>
he would add magazine after magazine to his growing list of patrons.&nbsp;
Hack-work could be put aside.&nbsp; For that matter, it had been wasted
time, for it had not brought him a dollar.&nbsp; He would devote himself
to work, good work, and he would pour out the best that was in him.&nbsp;
He wished Ruth was there to share in his joy, and when he went over
the letters left lying on his bed, he found one from her.&nbsp; It was
sweetly reproachful, wondering what had kept him away for so dreadful
a length of time.&nbsp; He reread the letter adoringly, dwelling over
her handwriting, loving each stroke of her pen, and in the end kissing
her signature.</p>
<p>And when he answered, he told her recklessly that he had not been
to see her because his best clothes were in pawn.&nbsp; He told her
that he had been sick, but was once more nearly well, and that inside
ten days or two weeks (as soon as a letter could travel to New York
City and return) he would redeem his clothes and be with her.</p>
<p>But Ruth did not care to wait ten days or two weeks.&nbsp; Besides,
her lover was sick.&nbsp; The next afternoon, accompanied by Arthur,
she arrived in the Morse carriage, to the unqualified delight of the
Silva tribe and of all the urchins on the street, and to the consternation
of Maria.&nbsp; She boxed the ears of the Silvas who crowded about the
visitors on the tiny front porch, and in more than usual atrocious English
tried to apologize for her appearance.&nbsp; Sleeves rolled up from
soap-flecked arms and a wet gunny-sack around her waist told of the
task at which she had been caught.&nbsp; So flustered was she by two
such grand young people asking for her lodger, that she forgot to invite
them to sit down in the little parlor.&nbsp; To enter Martin&rsquo;s
room, they passed through the kitchen, warm and moist and steamy from
the big washing in progress.&nbsp; Maria, in her excitement, jammed
the bedroom and bedroom-closet doors together, and for five minutes,
through the partly open door, clouds of steam, smelling of soap-suds
and dirt, poured into the sick chamber.</p>
<p>Ruth succeeded in veering right and left and right again, and in
running the narrow passage between table and bed to Martin&rsquo;s side;
but Arthur veered too wide and fetched up with clatter and bang of pots
and pans in the corner where Martin did his cooking.&nbsp; Arthur did
not linger long.&nbsp; Ruth occupied the only chair, and having done
his duty, he went outside and stood by the gate, the centre of seven
marvelling Silvas, who watched him as they would have watched a curiosity
in a side-show.&nbsp; All about the carriage were gathered the children
from a dozen blocks, waiting and eager for some tragic and terrible
d&eacute;nouement.&nbsp; Carriages were seen on their street only for
weddings and funerals.&nbsp; Here was neither marriage nor death: therefore,
it was something transcending experience and well worth waiting for.</p>
<p>Martin had been wild to see Ruth.&nbsp; His was essentially a love-nature,
and he possessed more than the average man&rsquo;s need for sympathy.&nbsp;
He was starving for sympathy, which, with him, meant intelligent understanding;
and he had yet to learn that Ruth&rsquo;s sympathy was largely sentimental
and tactful, and that it proceeded from gentleness of nature rather
than from understanding of the objects of her sympathy.&nbsp; So it
was while Martin held her hand and gladly talked, that her love for
him prompted her to press his hand in return, and that her eyes were
moist and luminous at sight of his helplessness and of the marks suffering
had stamped upon his face.</p>
<p>But while he told her of his two acceptances, of his despair when
he received the one from the <i>Transcontinental</i>, and of the corresponding
delight with which he received the one from the <i>White Mouse</i>,
she did not follow him.&nbsp; She heard the words he uttered and understood
their literal import, but she was not with him in his despair and his
delight.&nbsp; She could not get out of herself.&nbsp; She was not interested
in selling stories to magazines.&nbsp; What was important to her was
matrimony.&nbsp; She was not aware of it, however, any more than she
was aware that her desire that Martin take a position was the instinctive
and preparative impulse of motherhood.&nbsp; She would have blushed
had she been told as much in plain, set terms, and next, she might have
grown indignant and asserted that her sole interest lay in the man she
loved and her desire for him to make the best of himself.&nbsp; So,
while Martin poured out his heart to her, elated with the first success
his chosen work in the world had received, she paid heed to his bare
words only, gazing now and again about the room, shocked by what she
saw.</p>
<p>For the first time Ruth gazed upon the sordid face of poverty.&nbsp;
Starving lovers had always seemed romantic to her,&mdash;but she had
had no idea how starving lovers lived.&nbsp; She had never dreamed it
could be like this.&nbsp; Ever her gaze shifted from the room to him
and back again.&nbsp; The steamy smell of dirty clothes, which had entered
with her from the kitchen, was sickening.&nbsp; Martin must be soaked
with it, Ruth concluded, if that awful woman washed frequently.&nbsp;
Such was the contagiousness of degradation.&nbsp; When she looked at
Martin, she seemed to see the smirch left upon him by his surroundings.&nbsp;
She had never seen him unshaven, and the three days&rsquo; growth of
beard on his face was repulsive to her.&nbsp; Not alone did it give
him the same dark and murky aspect of the Silva house, inside and out,
but it seemed to emphasize that animal-like strength of his which she
detested.&nbsp; And here he was, being confirmed in his madness by the
two acceptances he took such pride in telling her about.&nbsp; A little
longer and he would have surrendered and gone to work.&nbsp; Now he
would continue on in this horrible house, writing and starving for a
few more months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that smell?&rdquo; she asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of Maria&rsquo;s washing smells, I imagine,&rdquo; was
the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am growing quite accustomed to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; not that.&nbsp; It is something else.&nbsp; A stale,
sickish smell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin sampled the air before replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t smell anything else, except stale tobacco smoke,&rdquo;
he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; It is terrible.&nbsp; Why do you smoke
so much, Martin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, except that I smoke more than usual when
I am lonely.&nbsp; And then, too, it&rsquo;s such a long-standing habit.&nbsp;
I learned when I was only a youngster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a nice habit, you know,&rdquo; she reproved.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It smells to heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fault of the tobacco.&nbsp; I can afford
only the cheapest.&nbsp; But wait until I get that forty-dollar check.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll use a brand that is not offensive even to the angels.&nbsp;
But that wasn&rsquo;t so bad, was it, two acceptances in three days?&nbsp;
That forty-five dollars will pay about all my debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For two years&rsquo; work?&rdquo; she queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, for less than a week&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; Please pass me
that book over on the far corner of the table, the account book with
the gray cover.&rdquo;&nbsp; He opened it and began turning over the
pages rapidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I was right.&nbsp; Four days for &lsquo;The
Ring of Bells,&rsquo; two days for &lsquo;The Whirlpool.&rsquo;&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s forty-five dollars for a week&rsquo;s work, one hundred
and eighty dollars a month.&nbsp; That beats any salary I can command.&nbsp;
And, besides, I&rsquo;m just beginning.&nbsp; A thousand dollars a month
is not too much to buy for you all I want you to have.&nbsp; A salary
of five hundred a month would be too small.&nbsp; That forty-five dollars
is just a starter.&nbsp; Wait till I get my stride.&nbsp; Then watch
my smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth misunderstood his slang, and reverted to cigarettes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You smoke more than enough as it is, and the brand of tobacco
will make no difference.&nbsp; It is the smoking itself that is not
nice, no matter what the brand may be.&nbsp; You are a chimney, a living
volcano, a perambulating smoke-stack, and you are a perfect disgrace,
Martin dear, you know you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned toward him, entreaty in her eyes, and as he looked at
her delicate face and into her pure, limpid eyes, as of old he was struck
with his own unworthiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t smoke any more,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Please, for&mdash;my sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
do anything you ask, dear love, anything; you know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great temptation assailed her.&nbsp; In an insistent way she had
caught glimpses of the large, easy-going side of his nature, and she
felt sure, if she asked him to cease attempting to write, that he would
grant her wish.&nbsp; In the swift instant that elapsed, the words trembled
on her lips.&nbsp; But she did not utter them.&nbsp; She was not quite
brave enough; she did not quite dare.&nbsp; Instead, she leaned toward
him to meet him, and in his arms murmured:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, it is really not for my sake, Martin, but for your
own.&nbsp; I am sure smoking hurts you; and besides, it is not good
to be a slave to anything, to a drug least of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall always be your slave,&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In which case, I shall begin issuing my commands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him mischievously, though deep down she was already
regretting that she had not preferred her largest request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I live but to obey, your majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, my first commandment is, Thou shalt not omit to
shave every day.&nbsp; Look how you have scratched my cheek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it ended in caresses and love-laughter.&nbsp; But she had
made one point, and she could not expect to make more than one at a
time.&nbsp; She felt a woman&rsquo;s pride in that she had made him
stop smoking.&nbsp; Another time she would persuade him to take a position,
for had he not said he would do anything she asked?</p>
<p>She left his side to explore the room, examining the clothes-lines
of notes overhead, learning the mystery of the tackle used for suspending
his wheel under the ceiling, and being saddened by the heap of manuscripts
under the table which represented to her just so much wasted time.&nbsp;
The oil-stove won her admiration, but on investigating the food shelves
she found them empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you haven&rsquo;t anything to eat, you poor dear,&rdquo;
she said with tender compassion.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must be starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I store my food in Maria&rsquo;s safe and in her pantry,&rdquo;
he lied.&nbsp; &ldquo;It keeps better there.&nbsp; No danger of my starving.&nbsp;
Look at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had come back to his side, and she saw him double his arm at
the elbow, the biceps crawling under his shirt-sleeve and swelling into
a knot of muscle, heavy and hard.&nbsp; The sight repelled her.&nbsp;
Sentimentally, she disliked it.&nbsp; But her pulse, her blood, every
fibre of her, loved it and yearned for it, and, in the old, inexplicable
way, she leaned toward him, not away from him.&nbsp; And in the moment
that followed, when he crushed her in his arms, the brain of her, concerned
with the superficial aspects of life, was in revolt; while the heart
of her, the woman of her, concerned with life itself, exulted triumphantly.&nbsp;
It was in moments like this that she felt to the uttermost the greatness
of her love for Martin, for it was almost a swoon of delight to her
to feel his strong arms about her, holding her tightly, hurting her
with the grip of their fervor.&nbsp; At such moments she found justification
for her treason to her standards, for her violation of her own high
ideals, and, most of all, for her tacit disobedience to her mother and
father.&nbsp; They did not want her to marry this man.&nbsp; It shocked
them that she should love him.&nbsp; It shocked her, too, sometimes,
when she was apart from him, a cool and reasoning creature.&nbsp; With
him, she loved him&mdash;in truth, at times a vexed and worried love;
but love it was, a love that was stronger than she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This La Grippe is nothing,&rdquo; he was saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
hurts a bit, and gives one a nasty headache, but it doesn&rsquo;t compare
with break-bone fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had that, too?&rdquo; she queried absently, intent
on the heaven-sent justification she was finding in his arms.</p>
<p>And so, with absent queries, she led him on, till suddenly his words
startled her.</p>
<p>He had had the fever in a secret colony of thirty lepers on one of
the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you go there?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>Such royal carelessness of body seemed criminal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
never dreamed of lepers.&nbsp; When I deserted the schooner and landed
on the beach, I headed inland for some place of hiding.&nbsp; For three
days I lived off guavas, <i>ohia</i>-apples, and bananas, all of which
grew wild in the jungle.&nbsp; On the fourth day I found the trail&mdash;a
mere foot-trail.&nbsp; It led inland, and it led up.&nbsp; It was the
way I wanted to go, and it showed signs of recent travel.&nbsp; At one
place it ran along the crest of a ridge that was no more than a knife-edge.&nbsp;
The trail wasn&rsquo;t three feet wide on the crest, and on either side
the ridge fell away in precipices hundreds of feet deep.&nbsp; One man,
with plenty of ammunition, could have held it against a hundred thousand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the only way in to the hiding-place.&nbsp; Three hours
after I found the trail I was there, in a little mountain valley, a
pocket in the midst of lava peaks.&nbsp; The whole place was terraced
for taro-patches, fruit trees grew there, and there were eight or ten
grass huts.&nbsp; But as soon as I saw the inhabitants I knew what I&rsquo;d
struck.&nbsp; One sight of them was enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; Ruth demanded breathlessly, listening,
like any Desdemona, appalled and fascinated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing for me to do.&nbsp; Their leader was a kind old fellow,
pretty far gone, but he ruled like a king.&nbsp; He had discovered the
little valley and founded the settlement&mdash;all of which was against
the law.&nbsp; But he had guns, plenty of ammunition, and those Kanakas,
trained to the shooting of wild cattle and wild pig, were dead shots.&nbsp;
No, there wasn&rsquo;t any running away for Martin Eden.&nbsp; He stayed&mdash;for
three months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have been there yet, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
a girl there, a half-Chinese, quarter-white, and quarter-Hawaiian.&nbsp;
She was a beauty, poor thing, and well educated.&nbsp; Her mother, in
Honolulu, was worth a million or so.&nbsp; Well, this girl got me away
at last.&nbsp; Her mother financed the settlement, you see, so the girl
wasn&rsquo;t afraid of being punished for letting me go.&nbsp; But she
made me swear, first, never to reveal the hiding-place; and I never
have.&nbsp; This is the first time I have even mentioned it.&nbsp; The
girl had just the first signs of leprosy.&nbsp; The fingers of her right
hand were slightly twisted, and there was a small spot on her arm.&nbsp;
That was all.&nbsp; I guess she is dead, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But weren&rsquo;t you frightened?&nbsp; And weren&rsquo;t
you glad to get away without catching that dreadful disease?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;I was a bit shivery at first;
but I got used to it.&nbsp; I used to feel sorry for that poor girl,
though.&nbsp; That made me forget to be afraid.&nbsp; She was such a
beauty, in spirit as well as in appearance, and she was only slightly
touched; yet she was doomed to lie there, living the life of a primitive
savage and rotting slowly away.&nbsp; Leprosy is far more terrible than
you can imagine it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing,&rdquo; Ruth murmured softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a wonder she let you get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; Martin asked unwittingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she must have loved you,&rdquo; Ruth said, still softly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Candidly, now, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin&rsquo;s sunburn had been bleached by his work in the laundry
and by the indoor life he was living, while the hunger and the sickness
had made his face even pale; and across this pallor flowed the slow
wave of a blush.&nbsp; He was opening his mouth to speak, but Ruth shut
him off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, don&rsquo;t answer; it&rsquo;s not necessary,&rdquo;
she laughed.</p>
<p>But it seemed to him there was something metallic in her laughter,
and that the light in her eyes was cold.&nbsp; On the spur of the moment
it reminded him of a gale he had once experienced in the North Pacific.&nbsp;
And for the moment the apparition of the gale rose before his eyes&mdash;a
gale at night, with a clear sky and under a full moon, the huge seas
glinting coldly in the moonlight.&nbsp; Next, he saw the girl in the
leper refuge and remembered it was for love of him that she had let
him go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was noble,&rdquo; he said simply.&nbsp; &ldquo;She gave
me life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all of the incident, but he heard Ruth muffle a dry sob
in her throat, and noticed that she turned her face away to gaze out
of the window.&nbsp; When she turned it back to him, it was composed,
and there was no hint of the gale in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m such a silly,&rdquo; she said plaintively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; I do so love you, Martin, I
do, I do.&nbsp; I shall grow more catholic in time, but at present I
can&rsquo;t help being jealous of those ghosts of the past, and you
know your past is full of ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; she silenced his protest.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
could not be otherwise.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s poor Arthur motioning
me to come.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s tired waiting.&nbsp; And now good-by, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some kind of a mixture, put up by the druggists,
that helps men to stop the use of tobacco,&rdquo; she called back from
the door, &ldquo;and I am going to send you some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door closed, but opened again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, I do,&rdquo; she whispered to him; and this time she
was really gone.</p>
<p>Maria, with worshipful eyes that none the less were keen to note
the texture of Ruth&rsquo;s garments and the cut of them (a cut unknown
that produced an effect mysteriously beautiful), saw her to the carriage.&nbsp;
The crowd of disappointed urchins stared till the carriage disappeared
from view, then transferred their stare to Maria, who had abruptly become
the most important person on the street.&nbsp; But it was one of her
progeny who blasted Maria&rsquo;s reputation by announcing that the
grand visitors had been for her lodger.&nbsp; After that Maria dropped
back into her old obscurity and Martin began to notice the respectful
manner in which he was regarded by the small fry of the neighborhood.&nbsp;
As for Maria, Martin rose in her estimation a full hundred per cent,
and had the Portuguese grocer witnessed that afternoon carriage-call
he would have allowed Martin an additional three-dollars-and-eighty-five-cents&rsquo;
worth of credit.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<p>The sun of Martin&rsquo;s good fortune rose.&nbsp; The day after
Ruth&rsquo;s visit, he received a check for three dollars from a New
York scandal weekly in payment for three of his triolets.&nbsp; Two
days later a newspaper published in Chicago accepted his &ldquo;Treasure
Hunters,&rdquo; promising to pay ten dollars for it on publication.&nbsp;
The price was small, but it was the first article he had written, his
very first attempt to express his thought on the printed page.&nbsp;
To cap everything, the adventure serial for boys, his second attempt,
was accepted before the end of the week by a juvenile monthly calling
itself <i>Youth and Age</i>.&nbsp; It was true the serial was twenty-one
thousand words, and they offered to pay him sixteen dollars on publication,
which was something like seventy-five cents a thousand words; but it
was equally true that it was the second thing he had attempted to write
and that he was himself thoroughly aware of its clumsy worthlessness.</p>
<p>But even his earliest efforts were not marked with the clumsiness
of mediocrity.&nbsp; What characterized them was the clumsiness of too
great strength&mdash;the clumsiness which the tyro betrays when he crushes
butterflies with battering rams and hammers out vignettes with a war-club.&nbsp;
So it was that Martin was glad to sell his early efforts for songs.&nbsp;
He knew them for what they were, and it had not taken him long to acquire
this knowledge.&nbsp; What he pinned his faith to was his later work.&nbsp;
He had striven to be something more than a mere writer of magazine fiction.&nbsp;
He had sought to equip himself with the tools of artistry.&nbsp; On
the other hand, he had not sacrificed strength.&nbsp; His conscious
aim had been to increase his strength by avoiding excess of strength.&nbsp;
Nor had he departed from his love of reality.&nbsp; His work was realism,
though he had endeavored to fuse with it the fancies and beauties of
imagination.&nbsp; What he sought was an impassioned realism, shot through
with human aspiration and faith.&nbsp; What he wanted was life as it
was, with all its spirit-groping and soul-reaching left in.</p>
<p>He had discovered, in the course of his reading, two schools of fiction.&nbsp;
One treated of man as a god, ignoring his earthly origin; the other
treated of man as a clod, ignoring his heaven-sent dreams and divine
possibilities.&nbsp; Both the god and the clod schools erred, in Martin&rsquo;s
estimation, and erred through too great singleness of sight and purpose.&nbsp;
There was a compromise that approximated the truth, though it flattered
not the school of god, while it challenged the brute-savageness of the
school of clod.&nbsp; It was his story, &ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo; which
had dragged with Ruth, that Martin believed had achieved his ideal of
the true in fiction; and it was in an essay, &ldquo;God and Clod,&rdquo;
that he had expressed his views on the whole general subject.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo; and all that he deemed his best work,
still went begging among the editors.&nbsp; His early work counted for
nothing in his eyes except for the money it brought, and his horror
stories, two of which he had sold, he did not consider high work nor
his best work.&nbsp; To him they were frankly imaginative and fantastic,
though invested with all the glamour of the real, wherein lay their
power.&nbsp; This investiture of the grotesque and impossible with reality,
he looked upon as a trick&mdash;a skilful trick at best.&nbsp; Great
literature could not reside in such a field.&nbsp; Their artistry was
high, but he denied the worthwhileness of artistry when divorced from
humanness.&nbsp; The trick had been to fling over the face of his artistry
a mask of humanness, and this he had done in the half-dozen or so stories
of the horror brand he had written before he emerged upon the high peaks
of &ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo; &ldquo;Joy,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pot,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Wine of Life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three dollars he received for the triolets he used to eke out
a precarious existence against the arrival of the <i>White Mouse</i>
check.&nbsp; He cashed the first check with the suspicious Portuguese
grocer, paying a dollar on account and dividing the remaining two dollars
between the baker and the fruit store.&nbsp; Martin was not yet rich
enough to afford meat, and he was on slim allowance when the <i>White
Mouse</i> check arrived.&nbsp; He was divided on the cashing of it.&nbsp;
He had never been in a bank in his life, much less been in one on business,
and he had a naive and childlike desire to walk into one of the big
banks down in Oakland and fling down his indorsed check for forty dollars.&nbsp;
On the other hand, practical common sense ruled that he should cash
it with his grocer and thereby make an impression that would later result
in an increase of credit.&nbsp; Reluctantly Martin yielded to the claims
of the grocer, paying his bill with him in full, and receiving in change
a pocketful of jingling coin.&nbsp; Also, he paid the other tradesmen
in full, redeemed his suit and his bicycle, paid one month&rsquo;s rent
on the type-writer, and paid Maria the overdue month for his room and
a month in advance.&nbsp; This left him in his pocket, for emergencies,
a balance of nearly three dollars.</p>
<p>In itself, this small sum seemed a fortune.&nbsp; Immediately on
recovering his clothes he had gone to see Ruth, and on the way he could
not refrain from jingling the little handful of silver in his pocket.&nbsp;
He had been so long without money that, like a rescued starving man
who cannot let the unconsumed food out of his sight, Martin could not
keep his hand off the silver.&nbsp; He was not mean, nor avaricious,
but the money meant more than so many dollars and cents.&nbsp; It stood
for success, and the eagles stamped upon the coins were to him so many
winged victories.</p>
<p>It came to him insensibly that it was a very good world.&nbsp; It
certainly appeared more beautiful to him.&nbsp; For weeks it had been
a very dull and sombre world; but now, with nearly all debts paid, three
dollars jingling in his pocket, and in his mind the consciousness of
success, the sun shone bright and warm, and even a rain-squall that
soaked unprepared pedestrians seemed a merry happening to him.&nbsp;
When he starved, his thoughts had dwelt often upon the thousands he
knew were starving the world over; but now that he was feasted full,
the fact of the thousands starving was no longer pregnant in his brain.&nbsp;
He forgot about them, and, being in love, remembered the countless lovers
in the world.&nbsp; Without deliberately thinking about it, <i>motifs</i>
for love-lyrics began to agitate his brain.&nbsp; Swept away by the
creative impulse, he got off the electric car, without vexation, two
blocks beyond his crossing.</p>
<p>He found a number of persons in the Morse home.&nbsp; Ruth&rsquo;s
two girl-cousins were visiting her from San Rafael, and Mrs. Morse,
under pretext of entertaining them, was pursuing her plan of surrounding
Ruth with young people.&nbsp; The campaign had begun during Martin&rsquo;s
enforced absence, and was already in full swing.&nbsp; She was making
a point of having at the house men who were doing things.&nbsp; Thus,
in addition to the cousins Dorothy and Florence, Martin encountered
two university professors, one of Latin, the other of English; a young
army officer just back from the Philippines, one-time school-mate of
Ruth&rsquo;s; a young fellow named Melville, private secretary to Joseph
Perkins, head of the San Francisco Trust Company; and finally of the
men, a live bank cashier, Charles Hapgood, a youngish man of thirty-five,
graduate of Stanford University, member of the Nile Club and the Unity
Club, and a conservative speaker for the Republican Party during campaigns&mdash;in
short, a rising young man in every way.&nbsp; Among the women was one
who painted portraits, another who was a professional musician, and
still another who possessed the degree of Doctor of Sociology and who
was locally famous for her social settlement work in the slums of San
Francisco.&nbsp; But the women did not count for much in Mrs. Morse&rsquo;s
plan.&nbsp; At the best, they were necessary accessories.&nbsp; The
men who did things must be drawn to the house somehow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited when you talk,&rdquo; Ruth admonished
Martin, before the ordeal of introduction began.</p>
<p>He bore himself a bit stiffly at first, oppressed by a sense of his
own awkwardness, especially of his shoulders, which were up to their
old trick of threatening destruction to furniture and ornaments.&nbsp;
Also, he was rendered self-conscious by the company.&nbsp; He had never
before been in contact with such exalted beings nor with so many of
them.&nbsp; Melville, the bank cashier, fascinated him, and he resolved
to investigate him at the first opportunity.&nbsp; For underneath Martin&rsquo;s
awe lurked his assertive ego, and he felt the urge to measure himself
with these men and women and to find out what they had learned from
the books and life which he had not learned.</p>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s eyes roved to him frequently to see how he was getting
on, and she was surprised and gladdened by the ease with which he got
acquainted with her cousins.&nbsp; He certainly did not grow excited,
while being seated removed from him the worry of his shoulders.&nbsp;
Ruth knew them for clever girls, superficially brilliant, and she could
scarcely understand their praise of Martin later that night at going
to bed.&nbsp; But he, on the other hand, a wit in his own class, a gay
quizzer and laughter-maker at dances and Sunday picnics, had found the
making of fun and the breaking of good-natured lances simple enough
in this environment.&nbsp; And on this evening success stood at his
back, patting him on the shoulder and telling him that he was making
good, so that he could afford to laugh and make laughter and remain
unabashed.</p>
<p>Later, Ruth&rsquo;s anxiety found justification.&nbsp; Martin and
Professor Caldwell had got together in a conspicuous corner, and though
Martin no longer wove the air with his hands, to Ruth&rsquo;s critical
eye he permitted his own eyes to flash and glitter too frequently, talked
too rapidly and warmly, grew too intense, and allowed his aroused blood
to redden his cheeks too much.&nbsp; He lacked decorum and control,
and was in decided contrast to the young professor of English with whom
he talked.</p>
<p>But Martin was not concerned with appearances!&nbsp; He had been
swift to note the other&rsquo;s trained mind and to appreciate his command
of knowledge.&nbsp; Furthermore, Professor Caldwell did not realize
Martin&rsquo;s concept of the average English professor.&nbsp; Martin
wanted him to talk shop, and, though he seemed averse at first, succeeded
in making him do it.&nbsp; For Martin did not see why a man should not
talk shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd and unfair,&rdquo; he had told Ruth weeks
before, &ldquo;this objection to talking shop.&nbsp; For what reason
under the sun do men and women come together if not for the exchange
of the best that is in them?&nbsp; And the best that is in them is what
they are interested in, the thing by which they make their living, the
thing they&rsquo;ve specialized on and sat up days and nights over,
and even dreamed about.&nbsp; Imagine Mr. Butler living up to social
etiquette and enunciating his views on Paul Verlaine or the German drama
or the novels of D&rsquo;Annunzio.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d be bored to death.&nbsp;
I, for one, if I must listen to Mr. Butler, prefer to hear him talk
about his law.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the best that is in him, and life is
so short that I want the best of every man and woman I meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Ruth had objected, &ldquo;there are the topics
of general interest to all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, you mistake,&rdquo; he had rushed on.&nbsp; &ldquo;All
persons in society, all cliques in society&mdash;or, rather, nearly
all persons and cliques&mdash;ape their betters.&nbsp; Now, who are
the best betters?&nbsp; The idlers, the wealthy idlers.&nbsp; They do
not know, as a rule, the things known by the persons who are doing something
in the world.&nbsp; To listen to conversation about such things would
mean to be bored, wherefore the idlers decree that such things are shop
and must not be talked about.&nbsp; Likewise they decree the things
that are not shop and which may be talked about, and those things are
the latest operas, latest novels, cards, billiards, cocktails, automobiles,
horse shows, trout fishing, tuna-fishing, big-game shooting, yacht sailing,
and so forth&mdash;and mark you, these are the things the idlers know.&nbsp;
In all truth, they constitute the shop-talk of the idlers.&nbsp; And
the funniest part of it is that many of the clever people, and all the
would-be clever people, allow the idlers so to impose upon them.&nbsp;
As for me, I want the best a man&rsquo;s got in him, call it shop vulgarity
or anything you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ruth had not understood.&nbsp; This attack of his on the established
had seemed to her just so much wilfulness of opinion.</p>
<p>So Martin contaminated Professor Caldwell with his own earnestness,
challenging him to speak his mind.&nbsp; As Ruth paused beside them
she heard Martin saying:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely don&rsquo;t pronounce such heresies in the University
of California?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Caldwell shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;The honest
taxpayer and the politician, you know.&nbsp; Sacramento gives us our
appropriations and therefore we kowtow to Sacramento, and to the Board
of Regents, and to the party press, or to the press of both parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s clear; but how about you?&rdquo; Martin
urged.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must be a fish out of the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few like me, I imagine, in the university pond.&nbsp; Sometimes
I am fairly sure I am out of water, and that I should belong in Paris,
in Grub Street, in a hermit&rsquo;s cave, or in some sadly wild Bohemian
crowd, drinking claret,&mdash;dago-red they call it in San Francisco,&mdash;dining
in cheap restaurants in the Latin Quarter, and expressing vociferously
radical views upon all creation.&nbsp; Really, I am frequently almost
sure that I was cut out to be a radical.&nbsp; But then, there are so
many questions on which I am not sure.&nbsp; I grow timid when I am
face to face with my human frailty, which ever prevents me from grasping
all the factors in any problem&mdash;human, vital problems, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as he talked on, Martin became aware that to his own lips had
come the &ldquo;Song of the Trade Wind&rdquo;:-</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am strongest at noon,<br />
But under the moon<br />
I stiffen the bunt of the sail.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was almost humming the words, and it dawned upon him that the
other reminded him of the trade wind, of the Northeast Trade, steady,
and cool, and strong.&nbsp; He was equable, he was to be relied upon,
and withal there was a certain bafflement about him.&nbsp; Martin had
the feeling that he never spoke his full mind, just as he had often
had the feeling that the trades never blew their strongest but always
held reserves of strength that were never used.&nbsp; Martin&rsquo;s
trick of visioning was active as ever.&nbsp; His brain was a most accessible
storehouse of remembered fact and fancy, and its contents seemed ever
ordered and spread for his inspection.&nbsp; Whatever occurred in the
instant present, Martin&rsquo;s mind immediately presented associated
antithesis or similitude which ordinarily expressed themselves to him
in vision.&nbsp; It was sheerly automatic, and his visioning was an
unfailing accompaniment to the living present.&nbsp; Just as Ruth&rsquo;s
face, in a momentary jealousy had called before his eyes a forgotten
moonlight gale, and as Professor Caldwell made him see again the Northeast
Trade herding the white billows across the purple sea, so, from moment
to moment, not disconcerting but rather identifying and classifying,
new memory-visions rose before him, or spread under his eyelids, or
were thrown upon the screen of his consciousness.&nbsp; These visions
came out of the actions and sensations of the past, out of things and
events and books of yesterday and last week&mdash;a countless host of
apparitions that, waking or sleeping, forever thronged his mind.</p>
<p>So it was, as he listened to Professor Caldwell&rsquo;s easy flow
of speech&mdash;the conversation of a clever, cultured man&mdash;that
Martin kept seeing himself down all his past.&nbsp; He saw himself when
he had been quite the hoodlum, wearing a &ldquo;stiff-rim&rdquo; Stetson
hat and a square-cut, double-breasted coat, with a certain swagger to
the shoulders and possessing the ideal of being as tough as the police
permitted.&nbsp; He did not disguise it to himself, nor attempt to palliate
it.&nbsp; At one time in his life he had been just a common hoodlum,
the leader of a gang that worried the police and terrorized honest,
working-class householders.&nbsp; But his ideals had changed.&nbsp;
He glanced about him at the well-bred, well-dressed men and women, and
breathed into his lungs the atmosphere of culture and refinement, and
at the same moment the ghost of his early youth, in stiff-rim and square-cut,
with swagger and toughness, stalked across the room.&nbsp; This figure,
of the corner hoodlum, he saw merge into himself, sitting and talking
with an actual university professor.</p>
<p>For, after all, he had never found his permanent abiding place.&nbsp;
He had fitted in wherever he found himself, been a favorite always and
everywhere by virtue of holding his own at work and at play and by his
willingness and ability to fight for his rights and command respect.&nbsp;
But he had never taken root.&nbsp; He had fitted in sufficiently to
satisfy his fellows but not to satisfy himself.&nbsp; He had been perturbed
always by a feeling of unrest, had heard always the call of something
from beyond, and had wandered on through life seeking it until he found
books and art and love.&nbsp; And here he was, in the midst of all this,
the only one of all the comrades he had adventured with who could have
made themselves eligible for the inside of the Morse home.</p>
<p>But such thoughts and visions did not prevent him from following
Professor Caldwell closely.&nbsp; And as he followed, comprehendingly
and critically, he noted the unbroken field of the other&rsquo;s knowledge.&nbsp;
As for himself, from moment to moment the conversation showed him gaps
and open stretches, whole subjects with which he was unfamiliar.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, thanks to his Spencer, he saw that he possessed the outlines
of the field of knowledge.&nbsp; It was a matter only of time, when
he would fill in the outline.&nbsp; Then watch out, he thought&mdash;&rsquo;ware
shoal, everybody!&nbsp; He felt like sitting at the feet of the professor,
worshipful and absorbent; but, as he listened, he began to discern a
weakness in the other&rsquo;s judgments&mdash;a weakness so stray and
elusive that he might not have caught it had it not been ever present.&nbsp;
And when he did catch it, he leapt to equality at once.</p>
<p>Ruth came up to them a second time, just as Martin began to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you where you are wrong, or, rather, what
weakens your judgments,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You lack biology.&nbsp;
It has no place in your scheme of things.&mdash;Oh, I mean the real
interpretative biology, from the ground up, from the laboratory and
the test-tube and the vitalized inorganic right on up to the widest
aesthetic and sociological generalizations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth was appalled.&nbsp; She had sat two lecture courses under Professor
Caldwell and looked up to him as the living repository of all knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely follow you,&rdquo; he said dubiously.</p>
<p>Martin was not so sure but what he had followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll try to explain,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
remember reading in Egyptian history something to the effect that understanding
could not be had of Egyptian art without first studying the land question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; the professor nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it seems to me,&rdquo; Martin continued, &ldquo;that knowledge
of the land question, in turn, of all questions, for that matter, cannot
be had without previous knowledge of the stuff and the constitution
of life.&nbsp; How can we understand laws and institutions, religions
and customs, without understanding, not merely the nature of the creatures
that made them, but the nature of the stuff out of which the creatures
are made?&nbsp; Is literature less human than the architecture and sculpture
of Egypt?&nbsp; Is there one thing in the known universe that is not
subject to the law of evolution?&mdash;Oh, I know there is an elaborate
evolution of the various arts laid down, but it seems to me to be too
mechanical.&nbsp; The human himself is left out.&nbsp; The evolution
of the tool, of the harp, of music and song and dance, are all beautifully
elaborated; but how about the evolution of the human himself, the development
of the basic and intrinsic parts that were in him before he made his
first tool or gibbered his first chant?&nbsp; It is that which you do
not consider, and which I call biology.&nbsp; It is biology in its largest
aspects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I express myself incoherently, but I&rsquo;ve tried
to hammer out the idea.&nbsp; It came to me as you were talking, so
I was not primed and ready to deliver it.&nbsp; You spoke yourself of
the human frailty that prevented one from taking all the factors into
consideration.&nbsp; And you, in turn,&mdash;or so it seems to me,&mdash;leave
out the biological factor, the very stuff out of which has been spun
the fabric of all the arts, the warp and the woof of all human actions
and achievements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Ruth&rsquo;s amazement, Martin was not immediately crushed, and
that the professor replied in the way he did struck her as forbearance
for Martin&rsquo;s youth.&nbsp; Professor Caldwell sat for a full minute,
silent and fingering his watch chain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
that same criticism passed on me once before&mdash;by a very great man,
a scientist and evolutionist, Joseph Le Conte.&nbsp; But he is dead,
and I thought to remain undetected; and now you come along and expose
me.&nbsp; Seriously, though&mdash;and this is confession&mdash;I think
there is something in your contention&mdash;a great deal, in fact.&nbsp;
I am too classical, not enough up-to-date in the interpretative branches
of science, and I can only plead the disadvantages of my education and
a temperamental slothfulness that prevents me from doing the work.&nbsp;
I wonder if you&rsquo;ll believe that I&rsquo;ve never been inside a
physics or chemistry laboratory?&nbsp; It is true, nevertheless.&nbsp;
Le Conte was right, and so are you, Mr. Eden, at least to an extent&mdash;how
much I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth drew Martin away with her on a pretext; when she had got him
aside, whispering:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have monopolized Professor Caldwell that
way.&nbsp; There may be others who want to talk with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mistake,&rdquo; Martin admitted contritely.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;d got him stirred up, and he was so interesting that I did not
think.&nbsp; Do you know, he is the brightest, the most intellectual,
man I have ever talked with.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll tell you something
else.&nbsp; I once thought that everybody who went to universities,
or who sat in the high places in society, was just as brilliant and
intelligent as he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an exception,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so.&nbsp; Whom do you want me to talk to now?&mdash;Oh,
say, bring me up against that cashier-fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin talked for fifteen minutes with him, nor could Ruth have wished
better behavior on her lover&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; Not once did his eyes
flash nor his cheeks flush, while the calmness and poise with which
he talked surprised her.&nbsp; But in Martin&rsquo;s estimation the
whole tribe of bank cashiers fell a few hundred per cent, and for the
rest of the evening he labored under the impression that bank cashiers
and talkers of platitudes were synonymous phrases.&nbsp; The army officer
he found good-natured and simple, a healthy, wholesome young fellow,
content to occupy the place in life into which birth and luck had flung
him.&nbsp; On learning that he had completed two years in the university,
Martin was puzzled to know where he had stored it away.&nbsp; Nevertheless
Martin liked him better than the platitudinous bank cashier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t object to platitudes,&rdquo; he told
Ruth later; &ldquo;but what worries me into nervousness is the pompous,
smugly complacent, superior certitude with which they are uttered and
the time taken to do it.&nbsp; Why, I could give that man the whole
history of the Reformation in the time he took to tell me that the Union-Labor
Party had fused with the Democrats.&nbsp; Do you know, he skins his
words as a professional poker-player skins the cards that are dealt
out to him.&nbsp; Some day I&rsquo;ll show you what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; was her reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a favorite of Mr. Butler&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mr. Butler
says he is safe and honest&mdash;calls him the Rock, Peter, and says
that upon him any banking institution can well be built.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it&mdash;from the little I saw of him
and the less I heard from him; but I don&rsquo;t think so much of banks
as I did.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mind my speaking my mind this way, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; it is most interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Martin went on heartily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no more
than a barbarian getting my first impressions of civilization.&nbsp;
Such impressions must be entertainingly novel to the civilized person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think of my cousins?&rdquo; Ruth queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked them better than the other women.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
plenty of fun in them along with paucity of pretence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you did like the other women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That social-settlement woman is no more than a sociological
poll-parrot.&nbsp; I swear, if you winnowed her out between the stars,
like Tomlinson, there would be found in her not one original thought.&nbsp;
As for the portrait-painter, she was a positive bore.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d
make a good wife for the cashier.&nbsp; And the musician woman!&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t care how nimble her fingers are, how perfect her technique,
how wonderful her expression&mdash;the fact is, she knows nothing about
music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She plays beautifully,&rdquo; Ruth protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s undoubtedly gymnastic in the externals of
music, but the intrinsic spirit of music is unguessed by her.&nbsp;
I asked her what music meant to her&mdash;you know I&rsquo;m always
curious to know that particular thing; and she did not know what it
meant to her, except that she adored it, that it was the greatest of
the arts, and that it meant more than life to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were making them talk shop,&rdquo; Ruth charged him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess it.&nbsp; And if they were failures on shop, imagine
my sufferings if they had discoursed on other subjects.&nbsp; Why, I
used to think that up here, where all the advantages of culture were
enjoyed&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused for a moment, and watched the
youthful shade of himself, in stiff-rim and square-cut, enter the door
and swagger across the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I was saying, up here I
thought all men and women were brilliant and radiant.&nbsp; But now,
from what little I&rsquo;ve seen of them, they strike me as a pack of
ninnies, most of them, and ninety percent of the remainder as bores.&nbsp;
Now there&rsquo;s Professor Caldwell&mdash;he&rsquo;s different.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a man, every inch of him and every atom of his gray matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s face brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about him,&rdquo; she urged.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not what
is large and brilliant&mdash;I know those qualities; but whatever you
feel is adverse.&nbsp; I am most curious to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ll get myself in a pickle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Martin
debated humorously for a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose you tell me first.&nbsp;
Or maybe you find in him nothing less than the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I attended two lecture courses under him, and I have known
him for two years; that is why I am anxious for your first impression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad impression, you mean?&nbsp; Well, here goes.&nbsp; He
is all the fine things you think about him, I guess.&nbsp; At least,
he is the finest specimen of intellectual man I have met; but he is
a man with a secret shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; he hastened to cry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing
paltry nor vulgar.&nbsp; What I mean is that he strikes me as a man
who has gone to the bottom of things, and is so afraid of what he saw
that he makes believe to himself that he never saw it.&nbsp; Perhaps
that&rsquo;s not the clearest way to express it.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
another way.&nbsp; A man who has found the path to the hidden temple
but has not followed it; who has, perhaps, caught glimpses of the temple
and striven afterward to convince himself that it was only a mirage
of foliage.&nbsp; Yet another way.&nbsp; A man who could have done things
but who placed no value on the doing, and who, all the time, in his
innermost heart, is regretting that he has not done them; who has secretly
laughed at the rewards for doing, and yet, still more secretly, has
yearned for the rewards and for the joy of doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t read him that way,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
for that matter, I don&rsquo;t see just what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only a vague feeling on my part,&rdquo; Martin temporized.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have no reason for it.&nbsp; It is only a feeling, and most
likely it is wrong.&nbsp; You certainly should know him better than
I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the evening at Ruth&rsquo;s Martin brought away with him strange
confusions and conflicting feelings.&nbsp; He was disappointed in his
goal, in the persons he had climbed to be with.&nbsp; On the other hand,
he was encouraged with his success.&nbsp; The climb had been easier
than he expected.&nbsp; He was superior to the climb, and (he did not,
with false modesty, hide it from himself) he was superior to the beings
among whom he had climbed&mdash;with the exception, of course, of Professor
Caldwell.&nbsp; About life and the books he knew more than they, and
he wondered into what nooks and crannies they had cast aside their educations.&nbsp;
He did not know that he was himself possessed of unusual brain vigor;
nor did he know that the persons who were given to probing the depths
and to thinking ultimate thoughts were not to be found in the drawing
rooms of the world&rsquo;s Morses; nor did he dream that such persons
were as lonely eagles sailing solitary in the azure sky far above the
earth and its swarming freight of gregarious life.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<p>But success had lost Martin&rsquo;s address, and her messengers no
longer came to his door.&nbsp; For twenty-five days, working Sundays
and holidays, he toiled on &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun,&rdquo; a long
essay of some thirty thousand words.&nbsp; It was a deliberate attack
on the mysticism of the Maeterlinck school&mdash;an attack from the
citadel of positive science upon the wonder-dreamers, but an attack
nevertheless that retained much of beauty and wonder of the sort compatible
with ascertained fact.&nbsp; It was a little later that he followed
up the attack with two short essays, &ldquo;The Wonder-Dreamers&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Yardstick of the Ego.&rdquo;&nbsp; And on essays, long
and short, he began to pay the travelling expenses from magazine to
magazine.</p>
<p>During the twenty-five days spent on &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun,&rdquo;
he sold hack-work to the extent of six dollars and fifty cents.&nbsp;
A joke had brought in fifty cents, and a second one, sold to a high-grade
comic weekly, had fetched a dollar.&nbsp; Then two humorous poems had
earned two dollars and three dollars respectively.&nbsp; As a result,
having exhausted his credit with the tradesmen (though he had increased
his credit with the grocer to five dollars), his wheel and suit of clothes
went back to the pawnbroker.&nbsp; The type-writer people were again
clamoring for money, insistently pointing out that according to the
agreement rent was to be paid strictly in advance.</p>
<p>Encouraged by his several small sales, Martin went back to hack-work.&nbsp;
Perhaps there was a living in it, after all.&nbsp; Stored away under
his table were the twenty storiettes which had been rejected by the
newspaper short-story syndicate.&nbsp; He read them over in order to
find out how not to write newspaper storiettes, and so doing, reasoned
out the perfect formula.&nbsp; He found that the newspaper storiette
should never be tragic, should never end unhappily, and should never
contain beauty of language, subtlety of thought, nor real delicacy of
sentiment.&nbsp; Sentiment it must contain, plenty of it, pure and noble,
of the sort that in his own early youth had brought his applause from
&ldquo;nigger heaven&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;For-God-my-country-and-the-Czar&rdquo;
and &ldquo;I-may-be-poor-but-I-am-honest&rdquo; brand of sentiment.</p>
<p>Having learned such precautions, Martin consulted &ldquo;The Duchess&rdquo;
for tone, and proceeded to mix according to formula.&nbsp; The formula
consists of three parts: (1) a pair of lovers are jarred apart; (2)
by some deed or event they are reunited; (3) marriage bells.&nbsp; The
third part was an unvarying quantity, but the first and second parts
could be varied an infinite number of times.&nbsp; Thus, the pair of
lovers could be jarred apart by misunderstood motives, by accident of
fate, by jealous rivals, by irate parents, by crafty guardians, by scheming
relatives, and so forth and so forth; they could be reunited by a brave
deed of the man lover, by a similar deed of the woman lover, by change
of heart in one lover or the other, by forced confession of crafty guardian,
scheming relative, or jealous rival, by voluntary confession of same,
by discovery of some unguessed secret, by lover storming girl&rsquo;s
heart, by lover making long and noble self-sacrifice, and so on, endlessly.&nbsp;
It was very fetching to make the girl propose in the course of being
reunited, and Martin discovered, bit by bit, other decidedly piquant
and fetching ruses.&nbsp; But marriage bells at the end was the one
thing he could take no liberties with; though the heavens rolled up
as a scroll and the stars fell, the wedding bells must go on ringing
just the same.&nbsp; In quantity, the formula prescribed twelve hundred
words minimum dose, fifteen hundred words maximum dose.</p>
<p>Before he got very far along in the art of the storiette, Martin
worked out half a dozen stock forms, which he always consulted when
constructing storiettes.&nbsp; These forms were like the cunning tables
used by mathematicians, which may be entered from top, bottom, right,
and left, which entrances consist of scores of lines and dozens of columns,
and from which may be drawn, without reasoning or thinking, thousands
of different conclusions, all unchallengably precise and true.&nbsp;
Thus, in the course of half an hour with his forms, Martin could frame
up a dozen or so storiettes, which he put aside and filled in at his
convenience.&nbsp; He found that he could fill one in, after a day of
serious work, in the hour before going to bed.&nbsp; As he later confessed
to Ruth, he could almost do it in his sleep.&nbsp; The real work was
in constructing the frames, and that was merely mechanical.</p>
<p>He had no doubt whatever of the efficacy of his formula, and for
once he knew the editorial mind when he said positively to himself that
the first two he sent off would bring checks.&nbsp; And checks they
brought, for four dollars each, at the end of twelve days.</p>
<p>In the meantime he was making fresh and alarming discoveries concerning
the magazines.&nbsp; Though the <i>Transcontinental</i> had published
&ldquo;The Ring of Bells,&rdquo; no check was forthcoming.&nbsp; Martin
needed it, and he wrote for it.&nbsp; An evasive answer and a request
for more of his work was all he received.&nbsp; He had gone hungry two
days waiting for the reply, and it was then that he put his wheel back
in pawn.&nbsp; He wrote regularly, twice a week, to the <i>Transcontinental</i>
for his five dollars, though it was only semi-occasionally that he elicited
a reply.&nbsp; He did not know that the <i>Transcontinental</i> had
been staggering along precariously for years, that it was a fourth-rater,
or tenth-rater, without standing, with a crazy circulation that partly
rested on petty bullying and partly on patriotic appealing, and with
advertisements that were scarcely more than charitable donations.&nbsp;
Nor did he know that the <i>Transcontinental</i> was the sole livelihood
of the editor and the business manager, and that they could wring their
livelihood out of it only by moving to escape paying rent and by never
paying any bill they could evade.&nbsp; Nor could he have guessed that
the particular five dollars that belonged to him had been appropriated
by the business manager for the painting of his house in Alameda, which
painting he performed himself, on week-day afternoons, because he could
not afford to pay union wages and because the first scab he had employed
had had a ladder jerked out from under him and been sent to the hospital
with a broken collar-bone.</p>
<p>The ten dollars for which Martin had sold &ldquo;Treasure Hunters&rdquo;
to the Chicago newspaper did not come to hand.&nbsp; The article had
been published, as he had ascertained at the file in the Central Reading-room,
but no word could he get from the editor.&nbsp; His letters were ignored.&nbsp;
To satisfy himself that they had been received, he registered several
of them.&nbsp; It was nothing less than robbery, he concluded&mdash;a
cold-blooded steal; while he starved, he was pilfered of his merchandise,
of his goods, the sale of which was the sole way of getting bread to
eat.</p>
<p><i>Youth and Age</i> was a weekly, and it had published two-thirds
of his twenty-one-thousand-word serial when it went out of business.&nbsp;
With it went all hopes of getting his sixteen dollars.</p>
<p>To cap the situation, &ldquo;The Pot,&rdquo; which he looked upon
as one of the best things he had written, was lost to him.&nbsp; In
despair, casting about frantically among the magazines, he had sent
it to <i>The Billow</i>, a society weekly in San Francisco.&nbsp; His
chief reason for submitting it to that publication was that, having
only to travel across the bay from Oakland, a quick decision could be
reached.&nbsp; Two weeks later he was overjoyed to see, in the latest
number on the news-stand, his story printed in full, illustrated, and
in the place of honor.&nbsp; He went home with leaping pulse, wondering
how much they would pay him for one of the best things he had done.&nbsp;
Also, the celerity with which it had been accepted and published was
a pleasant thought to him.&nbsp; That the editor had not informed him
of the acceptance made the surprise more complete.&nbsp; After waiting
a week, two weeks, and half a week longer, desperation conquered diffidence,
and he wrote to the editor of <i>The Billow</i>, suggesting that possibly
through some negligence of the business manager his little account had
been overlooked.</p>
<p>Even if it isn&rsquo;t more than five dollars, Martin thought to
himself, it will buy enough beans and pea-soup to enable me to write
half a dozen like it, and possibly as good.</p>
<p>Back came a cool letter from the editor that at least elicited Martin&rsquo;s
admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thank you,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;for your excellent contribution.&nbsp;
All of us in the office enjoyed it immensely, and, as you see, it was
given the place of honor and immediate publication.&nbsp; We earnestly
hope that you liked the illustrations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On rereading your letter it seems to us that you are laboring
under the misapprehension that we pay for unsolicited manuscripts.&nbsp;
This is not our custom, and of course yours was unsolicited.&nbsp; We
assumed, naturally, when we received your story, that you understood
the situation.&nbsp; We can only deeply regret this unfortunate misunderstanding,
and assure you of our unfailing regard.&nbsp; Again, thanking you for
your kind contribution, and hoping to receive more from you in the near
future, we remain, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was also a postscript to the effect that though <i>The Billow</i>
carried no free-list, it took great pleasure in sending him a complimentary
subscription for the ensuing year.</p>
<p>After that experience, Martin typed at the top of the first sheet
of all his manuscripts: &ldquo;Submitted at your usual rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some day, he consoled himself, they will be submitted at <i>my</i>
usual rate.</p>
<p>He discovered in himself, at this period, a passion for perfection,
under the sway of which he rewrote and polished &ldquo;The Jostling
Street,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Wine of Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;Joy,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Sea Lyrics,&rdquo; and others of his earlier work.&nbsp; As of
old, nineteen hours of labor a day was all too little to suit him.&nbsp;
He wrote prodigiously, and he read prodigiously, forgetting in his toil
the pangs caused by giving up his tobacco.&nbsp; Ruth&rsquo;s promised
cure for the habit, flamboyantly labelled, he stowed away in the most
inaccessible corner of his bureau.&nbsp; Especially during his stretches
of famine he suffered from lack of the weed; but no matter how often
he mastered the craving, it remained with him as strong as ever.&nbsp;
He regarded it as the biggest thing he had ever achieved.&nbsp; Ruth&rsquo;s
point of view was that he was doing no more than was right.&nbsp; She
brought him the anti-tobacco remedy, purchased out of her glove money,
and in a few days forgot all about it.</p>
<p>His machine-made storiettes, though he hated them and derided them,
were successful.&nbsp; By means of them he redeemed all his pledges,
paid most of his bills, and bought a new set of tires for his wheel.&nbsp;
The storiettes at least kept the pot a-boiling and gave him time for
ambitious work; while the one thing that upheld him was the forty dollars
he had received from <i>The White Mouse</i>.&nbsp; He anchored his faith
to that, and was confident that the really first-class magazines would
pay an unknown writer at least an equal rate, if not a better one.&nbsp;
But the thing was, how to get into the first-class magazines.&nbsp;
His best stories, essays, and poems went begging among them, and yet,
each month, he read reams of dull, prosy, inartistic stuff between all
their various covers.&nbsp; If only one editor, he sometimes thought,
would descend from his high seat of pride to write me one cheering line!&nbsp;
No matter if my work is unusual, no matter if it is unfit, for prudential
reasons, for their pages, surely there must be some sparks in it, somewhere,
a few, to warm them to some sort of appreciation.&nbsp; And thereupon
he would get out one or another of his manuscripts, such as &ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo;
and read it over and over in a vain attempt to vindicate the editorial
silence.</p>
<p>As the sweet California spring came on, his period of plenty came
to an end.&nbsp; For several weeks he had been worried by a strange
silence on the part of the newspaper storiette syndicate.&nbsp; Then,
one day, came back to him through the mail ten of his immaculate machine-made
storiettes.&nbsp; They were accompanied by a brief letter to the effect
that the syndicate was overstocked, and that some months would elapse
before it would be in the market again for manuscripts.&nbsp; Martin
had even been extravagant on the strength of those ten storiettes.&nbsp;
Toward the last the syndicate had been paying him five dollars each
for them and accepting every one he sent.&nbsp; So he had looked upon
the ten as good as sold, and he had lived accordingly, on a basis of
fifty dollars in the bank.&nbsp; So it was that he entered abruptly
upon a lean period, wherein he continued selling his earlier efforts
to publications that would not pay and submitting his later work to
magazines that would not buy.&nbsp; Also, he resumed his trips to the
pawn-broker down in Oakland.&nbsp; A few jokes and snatches of humorous
verse, sold to the New York weeklies, made existence barely possible
for him.&nbsp; It was at this time that he wrote letters of inquiry
to the several great monthly and quarterly reviews, and learned in reply
that they rarely considered unsolicited articles, and that most of their
contents were written upon order by well-known specialists who were
authorities in their various fields.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<p>It was a hard summer for Martin.&nbsp; Manuscript readers and editors
were away on vacation, and publications that ordinarily returned a decision
in three weeks now retained his manuscript for three months or more.&nbsp;
The consolation he drew from it was that a saving in postage was effected
by the deadlock.&nbsp; Only the robber-publications seemed to remain
actively in business, and to them Martin disposed of all his early efforts,
such as &ldquo;Pearl-diving,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sea as a Career,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Turtle-catching,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Northeast Trades.&rdquo;&nbsp;
For these manuscripts he never received a penny.&nbsp; It is true, after
six months&rsquo; correspondence, he effected a compromise, whereby
he received a safety razor for &ldquo;Turtle-catching,&rdquo; and that
<i>The Acropolis</i>, having agreed to give him five dollars cash and
five yearly subscriptions: for &ldquo;The Northeast Trades,&rdquo; fulfilled
the second part of the agreement.</p>
<p>For a sonnet on Stevenson he managed to wring two dollars out of
a Boston editor who was running a magazine with a Matthew Arnold taste
and a penny-dreadful purse.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl,&rdquo;
a clever skit of a poem of two hundred lines, just finished, white hot
from his brain, won the heart of the editor of a San Francisco magazine
published in the interest of a great railroad.&nbsp; When the editor
wrote, offering him payment in transportation, Martin wrote back to
inquire if the transportation was transferable.&nbsp; It was not, and
so, being prevented from peddling it, he asked for the return of the
poem.&nbsp; Back it came, with the editor&rsquo;s regrets, and Martin
sent it to San Francisco again, this time to <i>The Hornet</i>, a pretentious
monthly that had been fanned into a constellation of the first magnitude
by the brilliant journalist who founded it.&nbsp; But <i>The Hornet&rsquo;s</i>
light had begun to dim long before Martin was born.&nbsp; The editor
promised Martin fifteen dollars for the poem, but, when it was published,
seemed to forget about it.&nbsp; Several of his letters being ignored,
Martin indicted an angry one which drew a reply.&nbsp; It was written
by a new editor, who coolly informed Martin that he declined to be held
responsible for the old editor&rsquo;s mistakes, and that he did not
think much of &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl&rdquo; anyway.</p>
<p>But <i>The Globe</i>, a Chicago magazine, gave Martin the most cruel
treatment of all.&nbsp; He had refrained from offering his &ldquo;Sea
Lyrics&rdquo; for publication, until driven to it by starvation.&nbsp;
After having been rejected by a dozen magazines, they had come to rest
in <i>The Globe</i> office.&nbsp; There were thirty poems in the collection,
and he was to receive a dollar apiece for them.&nbsp; The first month
four were published, and he promptly received a cheek for four dollars;
but when he looked over the magazine, he was appalled at the slaughter.&nbsp;
In some cases the titles had been altered: &ldquo;Finis,&rdquo; for
instance, being changed to &ldquo;The Finish,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Song of the Outer Reef&rdquo; to &ldquo;The Song of the Coral Reef.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In one case, an absolutely different title, a misappropriate title,
was substituted.&nbsp; In place of his own, &ldquo;Medusa Lights,&rdquo;
the editor had printed, &ldquo;The Backward Track.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
the slaughter in the body of the poems was terrifying.&nbsp; Martin
groaned and sweated and thrust his hands through his hair.&nbsp; Phrases,
lines, and stanzas were cut out, interchanged, or juggled about in the
most incomprehensible manner.&nbsp; Sometimes lines and stanzas not
his own were substituted for his.&nbsp; He could not believe that a
sane editor could be guilty of such maltreatment, and his favorite hypothesis
was that his poems must have been doctored by the office boy or the
stenographer.&nbsp; Martin wrote immediately, begging the editor to
cease publishing the lyrics and to return them to him.</p>
<p>He wrote again and again, begging, entreating, threatening, but his
letters were ignored.&nbsp; Month by month the slaughter went on till
the thirty poems were published, and month by month he received a check
for those which had appeared in the current number.</p>
<p>Despite these various misadventures, the memory of the <i>White Mouse</i>
forty-dollar check sustained him, though he was driven more and more
to hack-work.&nbsp; He discovered a bread-and-butter field in the agricultural
weeklies and trade journals, though among the religious weeklies he
found he could easily starve.&nbsp; At his lowest ebb, when his black
suit was in pawn, he made a ten-strike&mdash;or so it seemed to him&mdash;in
a prize contest arranged by the County Committee of the Republican Party.&nbsp;
There were three branches of the contest, and he entered them all, laughing
at himself bitterly the while in that he was driven to such straits
to live.&nbsp; His poem won the first prize of ten dollars, his campaign
song the second prize of five dollars, his essay on the principles of
the Republican Party the first prize of twenty-five dollars.&nbsp; Which
was very gratifying to him until he tried to collect.&nbsp; Something
had gone wrong in the County Committee, and, though a rich banker and
a state senator were members of it, the money was not forthcoming.&nbsp;
While this affair was hanging fire, he proved that he understood the
principles of the Democratic Party by winning the first prize for his
essay in a similar contest.&nbsp; And, moreover, he received the money,
twenty-five dollars.&nbsp; But the forty dollars won in the first contest
he never received.</p>
<p>Driven to shifts in order to see Ruth, and deciding that the long
walk from north Oakland to her house and back again consumed too much
time, he kept his black suit in pawn in place of his bicycle.&nbsp;
The latter gave him exercise, saved him hours of time for work, and
enabled him to see Ruth just the same.&nbsp; A pair of knee duck trousers
and an old sweater made him a presentable wheel costume, so that he
could go with Ruth on afternoon rides.&nbsp; Besides, he no longer had
opportunity to see much of her in her own home, where Mrs. Morse was
thoroughly prosecuting her campaign of entertainment.&nbsp; The exalted
beings he met there, and to whom he had looked up but a short time before,
now bored him.&nbsp; They were no longer exalted.&nbsp; He was nervous
and irritable, what of his hard times, disappointments, and close application
to work, and the conversation of such people was maddening.&nbsp; He
was not unduly egotistic.&nbsp; He measured the narrowness of their
minds by the minds of the thinkers in the books he read.&nbsp; At Ruth&rsquo;s
home he never met a large mind, with the exception of Professor Caldwell,
and Caldwell he had met there only once.&nbsp; As for the rest, they
were numskulls, ninnies, superficial, dogmatic, and ignorant.&nbsp;
It was their ignorance that astounded him.&nbsp; What was the matter
with them?&nbsp; What had they done with their educations?&nbsp; They
had had access to the same books he had.&nbsp; How did it happen that
they had drawn nothing from them?</p>
<p>He knew that the great minds, the deep and rational thinkers, existed.&nbsp;
He had his proofs from the books, the books that had educated him beyond
the Morse standard.&nbsp; And he knew that higher intellects than those
of the Morse circle were to be found in the world.&nbsp; He read English
society novels, wherein he caught glimpses of men and women talking
politics and philosophy.&nbsp; And he read of salons in great cities,
even in the United States, where art and intellect congregated.&nbsp;
Foolishly, in the past, he had conceived that all well-groomed persons
above the working class were persons with power of intellect and vigor
of beauty.&nbsp; Culture and collars had gone together, to him, and
he had been deceived into believing that college educations and mastery
were the same things.</p>
<p>Well, he would fight his way on and up higher.&nbsp; And he would
take Ruth with him.&nbsp; Her he dearly loved, and he was confident
that she would shine anywhere.&nbsp; As it was clear to him that he
had been handicapped by his early environment, so now he perceived that
she was similarly handicapped.&nbsp; She had not had a chance to expand.&nbsp;
The books on her father&rsquo;s shelves, the paintings on the walls,
the music on the piano&mdash;all was just so much meretricious display.&nbsp;
To real literature, real painting, real music, the Morses and their
kind, were dead.&nbsp; And bigger than such things was life, of which
they were densely, hopelessly ignorant.&nbsp; In spite of their Unitarian
proclivities and their masks of conservative broadmindedness, they were
two generations behind interpretative science: their mental processes
were mediaeval, while their thinking on the ultimate data of existence
and of the universe struck him as the same metaphysical method that
was as young as the youngest race, as old as the cave-man, and older&mdash;the
same that moved the first Pleistocene ape-man to fear the dark; that
moved the first hasty Hebrew savage to incarnate Eve from Adam&rsquo;s
rib; that moved Descartes to build an idealistic system of the universe
out of the projections of his own puny ego; and that moved the famous
British ecclesiastic to denounce evolution in satire so scathing as
to win immediate applause and leave his name a notorious scrawl on the
page of history.</p>
<p>So Martin thought, and he thought further, till it dawned upon him
that the difference between these lawyers, officers, business men, and
bank cashiers he had met and the members of the working class he had
known was on a par with the difference in the food they ate, clothes
they wore, neighborhoods in which they lived.&nbsp; Certainly, in all
of them was lacking the something more which he found in himself and
in the books.&nbsp; The Morses had shown him the best their social position
could produce, and he was not impressed by it.&nbsp; A pauper himself,
a slave to the money-lender, he knew himself the superior of those he
met at the Morses&rsquo;; and, when his one decent suit of clothes was
out of pawn, he moved among them a lord of life, quivering with a sense
of outrage akin to what a prince would suffer if condemned to live with
goat-herds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hate and fear the socialists,&rdquo; he remarked to Mr.
Morse, one evening at dinner; &ldquo;but why?&nbsp; You know neither
them nor their doctrines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation had been swung in that direction by Mrs. Morse,
who had been invidiously singing the praises of Mr. Hapgood.&nbsp; The
cashier was Martin&rsquo;s black beast, and his temper was a trifle
short where the talker of platitudes was concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;Charley Hapgood is what they
call a rising young man&mdash;somebody told me as much.&nbsp; And it
is true.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll make the Governor&rsquo;s Chair before he
dies, and, who knows? maybe the United States Senate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; Mrs. Morse had inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard him make a campaign speech.&nbsp; It was
so cleverly stupid and unoriginal, and also so convincing, that the
leaders cannot help but regard him as safe and sure, while his platitudes
are so much like the platitudes of the average voter that&mdash;oh,
well, you know you flatter any man by dressing up his own thoughts for
him and presenting them to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I actually think you are jealous of Mr. Hapgood,&rdquo; Ruth
had chimed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look of horror on Martin&rsquo;s face stirred Mrs. Morse to belligerence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely don&rsquo;t mean to say that Mr. Hapgood is stupid?&rdquo;
she demanded icily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more than the average Republican,&rdquo; was the retort,
&ldquo;or average Democrat, either.&nbsp; They are all stupid when they
are not crafty, and very few of them are crafty.&nbsp; The only wise
Republicans are the millionnaires and their conscious henchmen.&nbsp;
They know which side their bread is buttered on, and they know why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a Republican,&rdquo; Mr. Morse put in lightly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pray, how do you classify me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are an unconscious henchman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henchman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes.&nbsp; You do corporation work.&nbsp; You have no
working-class nor criminal practice.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t depend upon
wife-beaters and pickpockets for your income.&nbsp; You get your livelihood
from the masters of society, and whoever feeds a man is that man&rsquo;s
master.&nbsp; Yes, you are a henchman.&nbsp; You are interested in advancing
the interests of the aggregations of capital you serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Morse&rsquo;s face was a trifle red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you talk like
a scoundrelly socialist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it was that Martin made his remark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hate and fear the socialists; but why?&nbsp; You know
neither them nor their doctrines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your doctrine certainly sounds like socialism,&rdquo; Mr.
Morse replied, while Ruth gazed anxiously from one to the other, and
Mrs. Morse beamed happily at the opportunity afforded of rousing her
liege lord&rsquo;s antagonism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I say Republicans are stupid, and hold that liberty,
equality, and fraternity are exploded bubbles, does not make me a socialist,&rdquo;
Martin said with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because I question Jefferson
and the unscientific Frenchmen who informed his mind, does not make
me a socialist.&nbsp; Believe me, Mr. Morse, you are far nearer socialism
than I who am its avowed enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you please to be facetious,&rdquo; was all the other could
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; I speak in all seriousness.&nbsp; You still
believe in equality, and yet you do the work of the corporations, and
the corporations, from day to day, are busily engaged in burying equality.&nbsp;
And you call me a socialist because I deny equality, because I affirm
just what you live up to.&nbsp; The Republicans are foes to equality,
though most of them fight the battle against equality with the very
word itself the slogan on their lips.&nbsp; In the name of equality
they destroy equality.&nbsp; That was why I called them stupid.&nbsp;
As for myself, I am an individualist.&nbsp; I believe the race is to
the swift, the battle to the strong.&nbsp; Such is the lesson I have
learned from biology, or at least think I have learned.&nbsp; As I said,
I am an individualist, and individualism is the hereditary and eternal
foe of socialism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you frequent socialist meetings,&rdquo; Mr. Morse challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, just as spies frequent hostile camps.&nbsp; How
else are you to learn about the enemy?&nbsp; Besides, I enjoy myself
at their meetings.&nbsp; They are good fighters, and, right or wrong,
they have read the books.&nbsp; Any one of them knows far more about
sociology and all the other ologies than the average captain of industry.&nbsp;
Yes, I have been to half a dozen of their meetings, but that doesn&rsquo;t
make me a socialist any more than hearing Charley Hapgood orate made
me a Republican.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; Mr. Morse said feebly, &ldquo;but
I still believe you incline that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bless me, Martin thought to himself, he doesn&rsquo;t know what I
was talking about.&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t understood a word of it.&nbsp;
What did he do with his education, anyway?</p>
<p>Thus, in his development, Martin found himself face to face with
economic morality, or the morality of class; and soon it became to him
a grisly monster.&nbsp; Personally, he was an intellectual moralist,
and more offending to him than platitudinous pomposity was the morality
of those about him, which was a curious hotchpotch of the economic,
the metaphysical, the sentimental, and the imitative.</p>
<p>A sample of this curious messy mixture he encountered nearer home.&nbsp;
His sister Marian had been keeping company with an industrious young
mechanic, of German extraction, who, after thoroughly learning the trade,
had set up for himself in a bicycle-repair shop.&nbsp; Also, having
got the agency for a low-grade make of wheel, he was prosperous.&nbsp;
Marian had called on Martin in his room a short time before to announce
her engagement, during which visit she had playfully inspected Martin&rsquo;s
palm and told his fortune.&nbsp; On her next visit she brought Hermann
von Schmidt along with her.&nbsp; Martin did the honors and congratulated
both of them in language so easy and graceful as to affect disagreeably
the peasant-mind of his sister&rsquo;s lover.&nbsp; This bad impression
was further heightened by Martin&rsquo;s reading aloud the half-dozen
stanzas of verse with which he had commemorated Marian&rsquo;s previous
visit.&nbsp; It was a bit of society verse, airy and delicate, which
he had named &ldquo;The Palmist.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was surprised, when
he finished reading it, to note no enjoyment in his sister&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
Instead, her eyes were fixed anxiously upon her betrothed, and Martin,
following her gaze, saw spread on that worthy&rsquo;s asymmetrical features
nothing but black and sullen disapproval.&nbsp; The incident passed
over, they made an early departure, and Martin forgot all about it,
though for the moment he had been puzzled that any woman, even of the
working class, should not have been flattered and delighted by having
poetry written about her.</p>
<p>Several evenings later Marian again visited him, this time alone.&nbsp;
Nor did she waste time in coming to the point, upbraiding him sorrowfully
for what he had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Marian,&rdquo; he chided, &ldquo;you talk as though you
were ashamed of your relatives, or of your brother at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am, too,&rdquo; she blurted out.</p>
<p>Martin was bewildered by the tears of mortification he saw in her
eyes.&nbsp; The mood, whatever it was, was genuine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Marian, why should your Hermann be jealous of my writing
poetry about my own sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t jealous,&rdquo; she sobbed.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
says it was indecent, ob&mdash;obscene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin emitted a long, low whistle of incredulity, then proceeded
to resurrect and read a carbon copy of &ldquo;The Palmist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; he said finally, proffering the
manuscript to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Read it yourself and show me whatever
strikes you as obscene&mdash;that was the word, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says so, and he ought to know,&rdquo; was the answer, with
a wave aside of the manuscript, accompanied by a look of loathing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And he says you&rsquo;ve got to tear it up.&nbsp; He says he
won&rsquo;t have no wife of his with such things written about her which
anybody can read.&nbsp; He says it&rsquo;s a disgrace, an&rsquo; he
won&rsquo;t stand for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Marian, this is nothing but nonsense,&rdquo;
Martin began; then abruptly changed his mind.</p>
<p>He saw before him an unhappy girl, knew the futility of attempting
to convince her husband or her, and, though the whole situation was
absurd and preposterous, he resolved to surrender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he announced, tearing the manuscript into
half a dozen pieces and throwing it into the waste-basket.</p>
<p>He contented himself with the knowledge that even then the original
type-written manuscript was reposing in the office of a New York magazine.&nbsp;
Marian and her husband would never know, and neither himself nor they
nor the world would lose if the pretty, harmless poem ever were published.</p>
<p>Marian, starting to reach into the waste-basket, refrained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>He nodded his head, regarding her thoughtfully as she gathered the
torn pieces of manuscript and tucked them into the pocket of her jacket&mdash;ocular
evidence of the success of her mission.&nbsp; She reminded him of Lizzie
Connolly, though there was less of fire and gorgeous flaunting life
in her than in that other girl of the working class whom he had seen
twice.&nbsp; But they were on a par, the pair of them, in dress and
carriage, and he smiled with inward amusement at the caprice of his
fancy which suggested the appearance of either of them in Mrs. Morse&rsquo;s
drawing-room.&nbsp; The amusement faded, and he was aware of a great
loneliness.&nbsp; This sister of his and the Morse drawing-room were
milestones of the road he had travelled.&nbsp; And he had left them
behind.&nbsp; He glanced affectionately about him at his few books.&nbsp;
They were all the comrades left to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he demanded in startled surprise.</p>
<p>Marian repeated her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I go to work?&rdquo;&nbsp; He broke into a
laugh that was only half-hearted.&nbsp; &ldquo;That Hermann of yours
has been talking to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; he commanded, and the nod of her head
affirmed his charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you tell that Hermann of yours to mind his own business;
that when I write poetry about the girl he&rsquo;s keeping company with
it&rsquo;s his business, but that outside of that he&rsquo;s got no
say so.&nbsp; Understand?</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll succeed as a writer, eh?&rdquo;
he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m no good?&mdash;that I&rsquo;ve
fallen down and am a disgrace to the family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be much better if you got a job,&rdquo; she
said firmly, and he saw she was sincere.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hermann says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn Hermann!&rdquo; he broke out good-naturedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
I want to know is when you&rsquo;re going to get married.&nbsp; Also,
you find out from your Hermann if he will deign to permit you to accept
a wedding present from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mused over the incident after she had gone, and once or twice
broke out into laughter that was bitter as he saw his sister and her
betrothed, all the members of his own class and the members of Ruth&rsquo;s
class, directing their narrow little lives by narrow little formulas&mdash;herd-creatures,
flocking together and patterning their lives by one another&rsquo;s
opinions, failing of being individuals and of really living life because
of the childlike formulas by which they were enslaved.&nbsp; He summoned
them before him in apparitional procession: Bernard Higginbotham arm
in arm with Mr. Butler, Hermann von Schmidt cheek by jowl with Charley
Hapgood, and one by one and in pairs he judged them and dismissed them&mdash;judged
them by the standards of intellect and morality he had learned from
the books.&nbsp; Vainly he asked: Where are the great souls, the great
men and women?&nbsp; He found them not among the careless, gross, and
stupid intelligences that answered the call of vision to his narrow
room.&nbsp; He felt a loathing for them such as Circe must have felt
for her swine.&nbsp; When he had dismissed the last one and thought
himself alone, a late-comer entered, unexpected and unsummoned.&nbsp;
Martin watched him and saw the stiff-rim, the square-cut, double-breasted
coat and the swaggering shoulders, of the youthful hoodlum who had once
been he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were like all the rest, young fellow,&rdquo; Martin sneered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your morality and your knowledge were just the same as theirs.&nbsp;
You did not think and act for yourself.&nbsp; Your opinions, like your
clothes, were ready made; your acts were shaped by popular approval.&nbsp;
You were cock of your gang because others acclaimed you the real thing.&nbsp;
You fought and ruled the gang, not because you liked to,&mdash;you know
you really despised it,&mdash;but because the other fellows patted you
on the shoulder.&nbsp; You licked Cheese-Face because you wouldn&rsquo;t
give in, and you wouldn&rsquo;t give in partly because you were an abysmal
brute and for the rest because you believed what every one about you
believed, that the measure of manhood was the carnivorous ferocity displayed
in injuring and marring fellow-creatures&rsquo; anatomies.&nbsp; Why,
you whelp, you even won other fellows&rsquo; girls away from them, not
because you wanted the girls, but because in the marrow of those about
you, those who set your moral pace, was the instinct of the wild stallion
and the bull-seal.&nbsp; Well, the years have passed, and what do you
think about it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in reply, the vision underwent a swift metamorphosis.&nbsp;
The stiff-rim and the square-cut vanished, being replaced by milder
garments; the toughness went out of the face, the hardness out of the
eyes; and, the face, chastened and refined, was irradiated from an inner
life of communion with beauty and knowledge.&nbsp; The apparition was
very like his present self, and, as he regarded it, he noted the student-lamp
by which it was illuminated, and the book over which it pored.&nbsp;
He glanced at the title and read, &ldquo;The Science of AEsthetics.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Next, he entered into the apparition, trimmed the student-lamp, and
himself went on reading &ldquo;The Science of AEsthetics.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<p>On a beautiful fall day, a day of similar Indian summer to that which
had seen their love declared the year before, Martin read his &ldquo;Love-cycle&rdquo;
to Ruth.&nbsp; It was in the afternoon, and, as before, they had ridden
out to their favorite knoll in the hills.&nbsp; Now and again she had
interrupted his reading with exclamations of pleasure, and now, as he
laid the last sheet of manuscript with its fellows, he waited her judgment.</p>
<p>She delayed to speak, and at last she spoke haltingly, hesitating
to frame in words the harshness of her thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they are beautiful, very beautiful,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t sell them, can you?&nbsp; You see what I
mean,&rdquo; she said, almost pleaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;This writing of
yours is not practical.&nbsp; Something is the matter&mdash;maybe it
is with the market&mdash;that prevents you from earning a living by
it.&nbsp; And please, dear, don&rsquo;t misunderstand me.&nbsp; I am
flattered, and made proud, and all that&mdash;I could not be a true
woman were it otherwise&mdash;that you should write these poems to me.&nbsp;
But they do not make our marriage possible.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see,
Martin?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think me mercenary.&nbsp; It is love, the
thought of our future, with which I am burdened.&nbsp; A whole year
has gone by since we learned we loved each other, and our wedding day
is no nearer.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think me immodest in thus talking about
our wedding, for really I have my heart, all that I am, at stake.&nbsp;
Why don&rsquo;t you try to get work on a newspaper, if you are so bound
up in your writing?&nbsp; Why not become a reporter?&mdash;for a while,
at least?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would spoil my style,&rdquo; was his answer, in a low,
monotonous voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have no idea how I&rsquo;ve worked
for style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those storiettes,&rdquo; she argued.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
called them hack-work.&nbsp; You wrote many of them.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t
they spoil your style?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the cases are different.&nbsp; The storiettes were ground
out, jaded, at the end of a long day of application to style.&nbsp;
But a reporter&rsquo;s work is all hack from morning till night, is
the one paramount thing of life.&nbsp; And it is a whirlwind life, the
life of the moment, with neither past nor future, and certainly without
thought of any style but reportorial style, and that certainly is not
literature.&nbsp; To become a reporter now, just as my style is taking
form, crystallizing, would be to commit literary suicide.&nbsp; As it
is, every storiette, every word of every storiette, was a violation
of myself, of my self-respect, of my respect for beauty.&nbsp; I tell
you it was sickening.&nbsp; I was guilty of sin.&nbsp; And I was secretly
glad when the markets failed, even if my clothes did go into pawn.&nbsp;
But the joy of writing the &lsquo;Love-cycle&rsquo;!&nbsp; The creative
joy in its noblest form!&nbsp; That was compensation for everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin did not know that Ruth was unsympathetic concerning the creative
joy.&nbsp; She used the phrase&mdash;it was on her lips he had first
heard it.&nbsp; She had read about it, studied about it, in the university
in the course of earning her Bachelorship of Arts; but she was not original,
not creative, and all manifestations of culture on her part were but
harpings of the harpings of others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May not the editor have been right in his revision of your
&lsquo;Sea Lyrics&rsquo;?&rdquo; she questioned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Remember,
an editor must have proved qualifications or else he would not be an
editor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s in line with the persistence of the established,&rdquo;
he rejoined, his heat against the editor-folk getting the better of
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is, is not only right, but is the best possible.&nbsp;
The existence of anything is sufficient vindication of its fitness to
exist&mdash;to exist, mark you, as the average person unconsciously
believes, not merely in present conditions, but in all conditions.&nbsp;
It is their ignorance, of course, that makes them believe such rot&mdash;their
ignorance, which is nothing more nor less than the henidical mental
process described by Weininger.&nbsp; They think they think, and such
thinkless creatures are the arbiters of the lives of the few who really
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, overcome by the consciousness that he had been talking
over Ruth&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know who this Weininger is,&rdquo;
she retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you are so dreadfully general that I
fail to follow you.&nbsp; What I was speaking of was the qualification
of editors&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he interrupted.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
chief qualification of ninety-nine per cent of all editors is failure.&nbsp;
They have failed as writers.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think they prefer the
drudgery of the desk and the slavery to their circulation and to the
business manager to the joy of writing.&nbsp; They have tried to write,
and they have failed.&nbsp; And right there is the cursed paradox of
it.&nbsp; Every portal to success in literature is guarded by those
watch-dogs, the failures in literature.&nbsp; The editors, sub-editors,
associate editors, most of them, and the manuscript-readers for the
magazines and book-publishers, most of them, nearly all of them, are
men who wanted to write and who have failed.&nbsp; And yet they, of
all creatures under the sun the most unfit, are the very creatures who
decide what shall and what shall not find its way into print&mdash;they,
who have proved themselves not original, who have demonstrated that
they lack the divine fire, sit in judgment upon originality and genius.&nbsp;
And after them come the reviewers, just so many more failures.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t tell me that they have not dreamed the dream and attempted
to write poetry or fiction; for they have, and they have failed.&nbsp;
Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod-liver oil.&nbsp;
But you know my opinion on the reviewers and the alleged critics.&nbsp;
There are great critics, but they are as rare as comets.&nbsp; If I
fail as a writer, I shall have proved for the career of editorship.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s bread and butter and jam, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s mind was quick, and her disapproval of her lover&rsquo;s
views was buttressed by the contradiction she found in his contention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Martin, if that be so, if all the doors are closed as
you have shown so conclusively, how is it possible that any of the great
writers ever arrived?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They arrived by achieving the impossible,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They did such blazing, glorious work as to burn to ashes those
that opposed them.&nbsp; They arrived by course of miracle, by winning
a thousand-to-one wager against them.&nbsp; They arrived because they
were Carlyle&rsquo;s battle-scarred giants who will not be kept down.&nbsp;
And that is what I must do; I must achieve the impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you fail?&nbsp; You must consider me as well, Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I fail?&rdquo;&nbsp; He regarded her for a moment as though
the thought she had uttered was unthinkable.&nbsp; Then intelligence
illumined his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I fail, I shall become an editor,
and you will be an editor&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She frowned at his facetiousness&mdash;a pretty, adorable frown that
made him put his arm around her and kiss it away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; she urged, by an effort
of will withdrawing herself from the fascination of his strength.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have talked with father and mother.&nbsp; I never before asserted
myself so against them.&nbsp; I demanded to be heard.&nbsp; I was very
undutiful.&nbsp; They are against you, you know; but I assured them
over and over of my abiding love for you, and at last father agreed
that if you wanted to, you could begin right away in his office.&nbsp;
And then, of his own accord, he said he would pay you enough at the
start so that we could get married and have a little cottage somewhere.&nbsp;
Which I think was very fine of him&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin, with the dull pain of despair at his heart, mechanically
reaching for the tobacco and paper (which he no longer carried) to roll
a cigarette, muttered something inarticulate, and Ruth went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, though, and don&rsquo;t let it hurt you&mdash;I tell
you, to show you precisely how you stand with him&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t
like your radical views, and he thinks you are lazy.&nbsp; Of course
I know you are not.&nbsp; I know you work hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How hard, even she did not know, was the thought in Martin&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how about my views?&nbsp;
Do you think they are so radical?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held her eyes and waited the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think them, well, very disconcerting,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>The question was answered for him, and so oppressed was he by the
grayness of life that he forgot the tentative proposition she had made
for him to go to work.&nbsp; And she, having gone as far as she dared,
was willing to wait the answer till she should bring the question up
again.</p>
<p>She had not long to wait.&nbsp; Martin had a question of his own
to propound to her.&nbsp; He wanted to ascertain the measure of her
faith in him, and within the week each was answered.&nbsp; Martin precipitated
it by reading to her his &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you become a reporter?&rdquo; she asked when
he had finished.&nbsp; &ldquo;You love writing so, and I am sure you
would succeed.&nbsp; You could rise in journalism and make a name for
yourself.&nbsp; There are a number of great special correspondents.&nbsp;
Their salaries are large, and their field is the world.&nbsp; They are
sent everywhere, to the heart of Africa, like Stanley, or to interview
the Pope, or to explore unknown Thibet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t like my essay?&rdquo; he rejoined.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You believe that I have some show in journalism but none in literature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; I do like it.&nbsp; It reads well.&nbsp; But I am
afraid it&rsquo;s over the heads of your readers.&nbsp; At least it
is over mine.&nbsp; It sounds beautiful, but I don&rsquo;t understand
it.&nbsp; Your scientific slang is beyond me.&nbsp; You are an extremist,
you know, dear, and what may be intelligible to you may not be intelligible
to the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine it&rsquo;s the philosophic slang that bothers you,&rdquo;
was all he could say.</p>
<p>He was flaming from the fresh reading of the ripest thought he had
expressed, and her verdict stunned him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter how poorly it is done,&rdquo; he persisted, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you see anything in it?&mdash;in the thought of it, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is so different from anything I have read.&nbsp; I
read Maeterlinck and understand him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His mysticism, you understand that?&rdquo; Martin flashed
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but this of yours, which is supposed to be an attack
upon him, I don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; Of course, if originality
counts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped her with an impatient gesture that was not followed by
speech.&nbsp; He became suddenly aware that she was speaking and that
she had been speaking for some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, your writing has been a toy to you,&rdquo; she
was saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely you have played with it long enough.&nbsp;
It is time to take up life seriously&mdash;<i>our</i> life, Martin.&nbsp;
Hitherto you have lived solely your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to go to work?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Father has offered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand all that,&rdquo; he broke in; &ldquo;but what
I want to know is whether or not you have lost faith in me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pressed his hand mutely, her eyes dim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your writing, dear,&rdquo; she admitted in a half-whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve read lots of my stuff,&rdquo; he went on brutally.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you think of it?&nbsp; Is it utterly hopeless?&nbsp;
How does it compare with other men&rsquo;s work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they sell theirs, and you&mdash;don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t answer my question.&nbsp; Do you think
that literature is not at all my vocation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will answer.&rdquo;&nbsp; She steeled herself to do
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you were made to write.&nbsp; Forgive
me, dear.&nbsp; You compel me to say it; and you know I know more about
literature than you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are a Bachelor of Arts,&rdquo; he said meditatively;
&ldquo;and you ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is more to be said,&rdquo; he continued, after a
pause painful to both.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know what I have in me.&nbsp;
No one knows that so well as I.&nbsp; I know I shall succeed.&nbsp;
I will not be kept down.&nbsp; I am afire with what I have to say in
verse, and fiction, and essay.&nbsp; I do not ask you to have faith
in that, though.&nbsp; I do not ask you to have faith in me, nor in
my writing.&nbsp; What I do ask of you is to love me and have faith
in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year ago I believed for two years.&nbsp; One of those years
is yet to run.&nbsp; And I do believe, upon my honor and my soul, that
before that year is run I shall have succeeded.&nbsp; You remember what
you told me long ago, that I must serve my apprenticeship to writing.&nbsp;
Well, I have served it.&nbsp; I have crammed it and telescoped it.&nbsp;
With you at the end awaiting me, I have never shirked.&nbsp; Do you
know, I have forgotten what it is to fall peacefully asleep.&nbsp; A
few million years ago I knew what it was to sleep my fill and to awake
naturally from very glut of sleep.&nbsp; I am awakened always now by
an alarm clock.&nbsp; If I fall asleep early or late, I set the alarm
accordingly; and this, and the putting out of the lamp, are my last
conscious actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I begin to feel drowsy, I change the heavy book I am
reading for a lighter one.&nbsp; And when I doze over that, I beat my
head with my knuckles in order to drive sleep away.&nbsp; Somewhere
I read of a man who was afraid to sleep.&nbsp; Kipling wrote the story.&nbsp;
This man arranged a spur so that when unconsciousness came, his naked
body pressed against the iron teeth.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ve done the
same.&nbsp; I look at the time, and I resolve that not until midnight,
or not until one o&rsquo;clock, or two o&rsquo;clock, or three o&rsquo;clock,
shall the spur be removed.&nbsp; And so it rowels me awake until the
appointed time.&nbsp; That spur has been my bed-mate for months.&nbsp;
I have grown so desperate that five and a half hours of sleep is an
extravagance.&nbsp; I sleep four hours now.&nbsp; I am starved for sleep.&nbsp;
There are times when I am light-headed from want of sleep, times when
death, with its rest and sleep, is a positive lure to me, times when
I am haunted by Longfellow&rsquo;s lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The sea is still and deep;<br />
All things within its bosom sleep;<br />
A single step and all is o&rsquo;er,<br />
A plunge, a bubble, and no more.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, this is sheer nonsense.&nbsp; It comes from nervousness,
from an overwrought mind.&nbsp; But the point is: Why have I done this?&nbsp;
For you.&nbsp; To shorten my apprenticeship.&nbsp; To compel Success
to hasten.&nbsp; And my apprenticeship is now served.&nbsp; I know my
equipment.&nbsp; I swear that I learn more each month than the average
college man learns in a year.&nbsp; I know it, I tell you.&nbsp; But
were my need for you to understand not so desperate I should not tell
you.&nbsp; It is not boasting.&nbsp; I measure the results by the books.&nbsp;
Your brothers, to-day, are ignorant barbarians compared with me and
the knowledge I have wrung from the books in the hours they were sleeping.&nbsp;
Long ago I wanted to be famous.&nbsp; I care very little for fame now.&nbsp;
What I want is you; I am more hungry for you than for food, or clothing,
or recognition.&nbsp; I have a dream of laying my head on your breast
and sleeping an aeon or so, and the dream will come true ere another
year is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His power beat against her, wave upon wave; and in the moment his
will opposed hers most she felt herself most strongly drawn toward him.&nbsp;
The strength that had always poured out from him to her was now flowering
in his impassioned voice, his flashing eyes, and the vigor of life and
intellect surging in him.&nbsp; And in that moment, and for the moment,
she was aware of a rift that showed in her certitude&mdash;a rift through
which she caught sight of the real Martin Eden, splendid and invincible;
and as animal-trainers have their moments of doubt, so she, for the
instant, seemed to doubt her power to tame this wild spirit of a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And another thing,&rdquo; he swept on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You love
me.&nbsp; But why do you love me?&nbsp; The thing in me that compels
me to write is the very thing that draws your love.&nbsp; You love me
because I am somehow different from the men you have known and might
have loved.&nbsp; I was not made for the desk and counting-house, for
petty business squabbling, and legal jangling.&nbsp; Make me do such
things, make me like those other men, doing the work they do, breathing
the air they breathe, developing the point of view they have developed,
and you have destroyed the difference, destroyed me, destroyed the thing
you love.&nbsp; My desire to write is the most vital thing in me.&nbsp;
Had I been a mere clod, neither would I have desired to write, nor would
you have desired me for a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you forget,&rdquo; she interrupted, the quick surface
of her mind glimpsing a parallel.&nbsp; &ldquo;There have been eccentric
inventors, starving their families while they sought such chimeras as
perpetual motion.&nbsp; Doubtless their wives loved them, and suffered
with them and for them, not because of but in spite of their infatuation
for perpetual motion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there have been
inventors who were not eccentric and who starved while they sought to
invent practical things; and sometimes, it is recorded, they succeeded.&nbsp;
Certainly I do not seek any impossibilities&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have called it &lsquo;achieving the impossible,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she interpolated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoke figuratively.&nbsp; I seek to do what men have done
before me&mdash;to write and to live by my writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her silence spurred him on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you, then, my goal is as much a chimera as perpetual motion?&rdquo;
he demanded.</p>
<p>He read her answer in the pressure of her hand on his&mdash;the pitying
mother-hand for the hurt child.&nbsp; And to her, just then, he was
the hurt child, the infatuated man striving to achieve the impossible.</p>
<p>Toward the close of their talk she warned him again of the antagonism
of her father and mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you love me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do!&nbsp; I do!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I love you, not them, and nothing they do can hurt me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Triumph sounded in his voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;For I have faith in your
love, not fear of their enmity.&nbsp; All things may go astray in this
world, but not love.&nbsp; Love cannot go wrong unless it be a weakling
that faints and stumbles by the way.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<p>Martin had encountered his sister Gertrude by chance on Broadway&mdash;as
it proved, a most propitious yet disconcerting chance.&nbsp; Waiting
on the corner for a car, she had seen him first, and noted the eager,
hungry lines of his face and the desperate, worried look of his eyes.&nbsp;
In truth, he was desperate and worried.&nbsp; He had just come from
a fruitless interview with the pawnbroker, from whom he had tried to
wring an additional loan on his wheel.&nbsp; The muddy fall weather
having come on, Martin had pledged his wheel some time since and retained
his black suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the black suit,&rdquo; the pawnbroker, who knew
his every asset, had answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell me
you&rsquo;ve gone and pledged it with that Jew, Lipka.&nbsp; Because
if you have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man had looked the threat, and Martin hastened to cry:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; I&rsquo;ve got it.&nbsp; But I want to wear it on
a matter of business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the mollified usurer had replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I want it on a matter of business before I can let you have
any more money.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m in it for my health?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a forty-dollar wheel, in good condition,&rdquo;
Martin had argued.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve only let me have seven
dollars on it.&nbsp; No, not even seven.&nbsp; Six and a quarter; you
took the interest in advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want some more, bring the suit,&rdquo; had been the
reply that sent Martin out of the stuffy little den, so desperate at
heart as to reflect it in his face and touch his sister to pity.</p>
<p>Scarcely had they met when the Telegraph Avenue car came along and
stopped to take on a crowd of afternoon shoppers.&nbsp; Mrs. Higginbotham
divined from the grip on her arm as he helped her on, that he was not
going to follow her.&nbsp; She turned on the step and looked down upon
him.&nbsp; His haggard face smote her to the heart again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you comin&rsquo;?&rdquo; she asked</p>
<p>The next moment she had descended to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m walking&mdash;exercise, you know,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go along for a few blocks,&rdquo; she announced.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mebbe it&rsquo;ll do me good.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t ben feelin&rsquo;
any too spry these last few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin glanced at her and verified her statement in her general slovenly
appearance, in the unhealthy fat, in the drooping shoulders, the tired
face with the sagging lines, and in the heavy fall of her feet, without
elasticity&mdash;a very caricature of the walk that belongs to a free
and happy body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better stop here,&rdquo; he said, though she had
already come to a halt at the first corner, &ldquo;and take the next
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&mdash;if I ain&rsquo;t all tired a&rsquo;ready!&rdquo;
she panted.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m just as able to walk as you in
them soles.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re that thin they&rsquo;ll bu&rsquo;st
long before you git out to North Oakland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a better pair at home,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out to dinner to-morrow,&rdquo; she invited irrelevantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Higginbotham won&rsquo;t be there.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
to San Leandro on business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin shook his head, but he had failed to keep back the wolfish,
hungry look that leapt into his eyes at the suggestion of dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a penny, Mart, and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re
walkin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Exercise!&rdquo;&nbsp; She tried to sniff contemptuously,
but succeeded in producing only a sniffle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, lemme
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, fumbling in her satchel, she pressed a five-dollar piece into
his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess I forgot your last birthday, Mart,&rdquo;
she mumbled lamely.</p>
<p>Martin&rsquo;s hand instinctively closed on the piece of gold.&nbsp;
In the same instant he knew he ought not to accept, and found himself
struggling in the throes of indecision.&nbsp; That bit of gold meant
food, life, and light in his body and brain, power to go on writing,
and&mdash;who was to say?&mdash;maybe to write something that would
bring in many pieces of gold.&nbsp; Clear on his vision burned the manuscripts
of two essays he had just completed.&nbsp; He saw them under the table
on top of the heap of returned manuscripts for which he had no stamps,
and he saw their titles, just as he had typed them&mdash;&ldquo;The
High Priests of Mystery,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Cradle of Beauty.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He had never submitted them anywhere.&nbsp; They were as good as anything
he had done in that line.&nbsp; If only he had stamps for them!&nbsp;
Then the certitude of his ultimate success rose up in him, an able ally
of hunger, and with a quick movement he slipped the coin into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you back, Gertrude, a hundred times over,&rdquo;
he gulped out, his throat painfully contracted and in his eyes a swift
hint of moisture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark my words!&rdquo; he cried with abrupt positiveness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Before the year is out I&rsquo;ll put an even hundred of those
little yellow-boys into your hand.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t ask you to believe
me.&nbsp; All you have to do is wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor did she believe.&nbsp; Her incredulity made her uncomfortable,
and failing of other expedient, she said:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re hungry, Mart.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s sticking
out all over you.&nbsp; Come in to meals any time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
send one of the children to tell you when Mr. Higginbotham ain&rsquo;t
to be there.&nbsp; An&rsquo; Mart&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited, though he knew in his secret heart what she was about
to say, so visible was her thought process to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s about time you got a job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll win out?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody has faith in me, Gertrude, except myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His voice was passionately rebellious.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done
good work already, plenty of it, and sooner or later it will sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know it is good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He faltered as the whole vast
field of literature and the history of literature stirred in his brain
and pointed the futility of his attempting to convey to her the reasons
for his faith.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, because it&rsquo;s better than ninety-nine
per cent of what is published in the magazines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish&rsquo;t you&rsquo;d listen to reason,&rdquo; she answered
feebly, but with unwavering belief in the correctness of her diagnosis
of what was ailing him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish&rsquo;t you&rsquo;d listen
to reason,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;an&rsquo; come to dinner to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Martin had helped her on the car, he hurried to the post-office
and invested three of the five dollars in stamps; and when, later in
the day, on the way to the Morse home, he stopped in at the post-office
to weigh a large number of long, bulky envelopes, he affixed to them
all the stamps save three of the two-cent denomination.</p>
<p>It proved a momentous night for Martin, for after dinner he met Russ
Brissenden.&nbsp; How he chanced to come there, whose friend he was
or what acquaintance brought him, Martin did not know.&nbsp; Nor had
he the curiosity to inquire about him of Ruth.&nbsp; In short, Brissenden
struck Martin as anaemic and feather-brained, and was promptly dismissed
from his mind.&nbsp; An hour later he decided that Brissenden was a
boor as well, what of the way he prowled about from one room to another,
staring at the pictures or poking his nose into books and magazines
he picked up from the table or drew from the shelves.&nbsp; Though a
stranger in the house he finally isolated himself in the midst of the
company, huddling into a capacious Morris chair and reading steadily
from a thin volume he had drawn from his pocket.&nbsp; As he read, he
abstractedly ran his fingers, with a caressing movement, through his
hair.&nbsp; Martin noticed him no more that evening, except once when
he observed him chaffing with great apparent success with several of
the young women.</p>
<p>It chanced that when Martin was leaving, he overtook Brissenden already
half down the walk to the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, is that you?&rdquo; Martin said.</p>
<p>The other replied with an ungracious grunt, but swung alongside.&nbsp;
Martin made no further attempt at conversation, and for several blocks
unbroken silence lay upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pompous old ass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suddenness and the virulence of the exclamation startled Martin.&nbsp;
He felt amused, and at the same time was aware of a growing dislike
for the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you go to such a place for?&rdquo; was abruptly flung
at him after another block of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you?&rdquo; Martin countered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; came back.&nbsp; &ldquo;At
least this is my first indiscretion.&nbsp; There are twenty-four hours
in each day, and I must spend them somehow.&nbsp; Come and have a drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Martin answered.</p>
<p>The next moment he was nonplussed by the readiness of his acceptance.&nbsp;
At home was several hours&rsquo; hack-work waiting for him before he
went to bed, and after he went to bed there was a volume of Weismann
waiting for him, to say nothing of Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s Autobiography,
which was as replete for him with romance as any thrilling novel.&nbsp;
Why should he waste any time with this man he did not like? was his
thought.&nbsp; And yet, it was not so much the man nor the drink as
was it what was associated with the drink&mdash;the bright lights, the
mirrors and dazzling array of glasses, the warm and glowing faces and
the resonant hum of the voices of men.&nbsp; That was it, it was the
voices of men, optimistic men, men who breathed success and spent their
money for drinks like men.&nbsp; He was lonely, that was what was the
matter with him; that was why he had snapped at the invitation as a
bonita strikes at a white rag on a hook.&nbsp; Not since with Joe, at
Shelly Hot Springs, with the one exception of the wine he took with
the Portuguese grocer, had Martin had a drink at a public bar.&nbsp;
Mental exhaustion did not produce a craving for liquor such as physical
exhaustion did, and he had felt no need for it.&nbsp; But just now he
felt desire for the drink, or, rather, for the atmosphere wherein drinks
were dispensed and disposed of.&nbsp; Such a place was the Grotto, where
Brissenden and he lounged in capacious leather chairs and drank Scotch
and soda.</p>
<p>They talked.&nbsp; They talked about many things, and now Brissenden
and now Martin took turn in ordering Scotch and soda.&nbsp; Martin,
who was extremely strong-headed, marvelled at the other&rsquo;s capacity
for liquor, and ever and anon broke off to marvel at the other&rsquo;s
conversation.&nbsp; He was not long in assuming that Brissenden knew
everything, and in deciding that here was the second intellectual man
he had met.&nbsp; But he noted that Brissenden had what Professor Caldwell
lacked&mdash;namely, fire, the flashing insight and perception, the
flaming uncontrol of genius.&nbsp; Living language flowed from him.&nbsp;
His thin lips, like the dies of a machine, stamped out phrases that
cut and stung; or again, pursing caressingly about the inchoate sound
they articulated, the thin lips shaped soft and velvety things, mellow
phrases of glow and glory, of haunting beauty, reverberant of the mystery
and inscrutableness of life; and yet again the thin lips were like a
bugle, from which rang the crash and tumult of cosmic strife, phrases
that sounded clear as silver, that were luminous as starry spaces, that
epitomized the final word of science and yet said something more&mdash;the
poet&rsquo;s word, the transcendental truth, elusive and without words
which could express, and which none the less found expression in the
subtle and all but ungraspable connotations of common words.&nbsp; He,
by some wonder of vision, saw beyond the farthest outpost of empiricism,
where was no language for narration, and yet, by some golden miracle
of speech, investing known words with unknown significances, he conveyed
to Martin&rsquo;s consciousness messages that were incommunicable to
ordinary souls.</p>
<p>Martin forgot his first impression of dislike.&nbsp; Here was the
best the books had to offer coming true.&nbsp; Here was an intelligence,
a living man for him to look up to.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am down in the dirt
at your feet,&rdquo; Martin repeated to himself again and again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve studied biology,&rdquo; he said aloud, in significant
allusion.</p>
<p>To his surprise Brissenden shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are stating truths that are substantiated only by
biology,&rdquo; Martin insisted, and was rewarded by a blank stare.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your conclusions are in line with the books which you must have
read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
my smattering of knowledge should enable me to short-cut my way to truth
is most reassuring.&nbsp; As for myself, I never bother to find out
if I am right or not.&nbsp; It is all valueless anyway.&nbsp; Man can
never know the ultimate verities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a disciple of Spencer!&rdquo; Martin cried triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t read him since adolescence, and all I read
then was his &lsquo;Education.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could gather knowledge as carelessly,&rdquo; Martin
broke out half an hour later.&nbsp; He had been closely analyzing Brissenden&rsquo;s
mental equipment.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a sheer dogmatist, and that&rsquo;s
what makes it so marvellous.&nbsp; You state dogmatically the latest
facts which science has been able to establish only by <i>&agrave; posteriori</i>
reasoning.&nbsp; You jump at correct conclusions.&nbsp; You certainly
short-cut with a vengeance.&nbsp; You feel your way with the speed of
light, by some hyperrational process, to truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was what used to bother Father Joseph, and Brother
Dutton,&rdquo; Brissenden replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he added;
&ldquo;I am not anything.&nbsp; It was a lucky trick of fate that sent
me to a Catholic college for my education.&nbsp; Where did you pick
up what you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while Martin told him, he was busy studying Brissenden, ranging
from a long, lean, aristocratic face and drooping shoulders to the overcoat
on a neighboring chair, its pockets sagged and bulged by the freightage
of many books.&nbsp; Brissenden&rsquo;s face and long, slender hands
were browned by the sun&mdash;excessively browned, Martin thought.&nbsp;
This sunburn bothered Martin.&nbsp; It was patent that Brissenden was
no outdoor man.&nbsp; Then how had he been ravaged by the sun?&nbsp;
Something morbid and significant attached to that sunburn, was Martin&rsquo;s
thought as he returned to a study of the face, narrow, with high cheek-bones
and cavernous hollows, and graced with as delicate and fine an aquiline
nose as Martin had ever seen.&nbsp; There was nothing remarkable about
the size of the eyes.&nbsp; They were neither large nor small, while
their color was a nondescript brown; but in them smouldered a fire,
or, rather, lurked an expression dual and strangely contradictory.&nbsp;
Defiant, indomitable, even harsh to excess, they at the same time aroused
pity.&nbsp; Martin found himself pitying him he knew not why, though
he was soon to learn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a lunger,&rdquo; Brissenden announced, offhand,
a little later, having already stated that he came from Arizona.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been down there a couple of years living on the climate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid to venture it up in this climate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no special emphasis of his repetition of Martin&rsquo;s
word.&nbsp; But Martin saw in that ascetic face the advertisement that
there was nothing of which it was afraid.&nbsp; The eyes had narrowed
till they were eagle-like, and Martin almost caught his breath as he
noted the eagle beak with its dilated nostrils, defiant, assertive,
aggressive.&nbsp; Magnificent, was what he commented to himself, his
blood thrilling at the sight.&nbsp; Aloud, he quoted:-</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Under the bludgeoning of Chance<br />
My head is bloody but unbowed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You like Henley,&rdquo; Brissenden said, his expression changing
swiftly to large graciousness and tenderness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course,
I couldn&rsquo;t have expected anything else of you.&nbsp; Ah, Henley!&nbsp;
A brave soul.&nbsp; He stands out among contemporary rhymesters&mdash;magazine
rhymesters&mdash;as a gladiator stands out in the midst of a band of
eunuchs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like the magazines,&rdquo; Martin softly impeached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; was snarled back at him so savagely as to startle
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I write, or, rather, try to write, for the magazines,&rdquo;
Martin faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; was the mollified rejoinder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You try to write, but you don&rsquo;t succeed.&nbsp; I respect
and admire your failure.&nbsp; I know what you write.&nbsp; I can see
it with half an eye, and there&rsquo;s one ingredient in it that shuts
it out of the magazines.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s guts, and magazines have no
use for that particular commodity.&nbsp; What they want is wish-wash
and slush, and God knows they get it, but not from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not above hack-work,&rdquo; Martin contended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Brissenden paused and
ran an insolent eye over Martin&rsquo;s objective poverty, passing from
the well-worn tie and the saw-edged collar to the shiny sleeves of the
coat and on to the slight fray of one cuff, winding up and dwelling
upon Martin&rsquo;s sunken cheeks.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the contrary, hack-work
is above you, so far above you that you can never hope to rise to it.&nbsp;
Why, man, I could insult you by asking you to have something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin felt the heat in his face of the involuntary blood, and Brissenden
laughed triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A full man is not insulted by such an invitation,&rdquo; he
concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a devil,&rdquo; Martin cried irritably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know about that.&nbsp; I invite you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brissenden half rose from his chair as he spoke, as if with the intention
of departing to the restaurant forthwith.</p>
<p>Martin&rsquo;s fists were tight-clenched, and his blood was drumming
in his temples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bosco!&nbsp; He eats &rsquo;em alive!&nbsp; Eats &rsquo;em
alive!&rdquo;&nbsp; Brissenden exclaimed, imitating the <i>spieler</i>
of a locally famous snake-eater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could certainly eat you alive,&rdquo; Martin said, in turn
running insolent eyes over the other&rsquo;s disease-ravaged frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only I&rsquo;m not worthy of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; Martin considered, &ldquo;because
the incident is not worthy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He broke into a laugh, hearty
and wholesome.&nbsp; &ldquo;I confess you made a fool of me, Brissenden.&nbsp;
That I am hungry and you are aware of it are only ordinary phenomena,
and there&rsquo;s no disgrace.&nbsp; You see, I laugh at the conventional
little moralities of the herd; then you drift by, say a sharp, true
word, and immediately I am the slave of the same little moralities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were insulted,&rdquo; Brissenden affirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly was, a moment ago.&nbsp; The prejudice of early
youth, you know.&nbsp; I learned such things then, and they cheapen
what I have since learned.&nbsp; They are the skeletons in my particular
closet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got the door shut on them now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go and get something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go you,&rdquo; Martin answered, attempting to pay
for the current Scotch and soda with the last change from his two dollars
and seeing the waiter bullied by Brissenden into putting that change
back on the table.</p>
<p>Martin pocketed it with a grimace, and felt for a moment the kindly
weight of Brissenden&rsquo;s hand upon his shoulder.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<p>Promptly, the next afternoon, Maria was excited by Martin&rsquo;s
second visitor.&nbsp; But she did not lose her head this time, for she
seated Brissenden in her parlor&rsquo;s grandeur of respectability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you don&rsquo;t mind my coming?&rdquo; Brissenden began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not at all,&rdquo; Martin answered, shaking hands
and waving him to the solitary chair, himself taking to the bed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But how did you know where I lived?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Called up the Morses.&nbsp; Miss Morse answered the &rsquo;phone.&nbsp;
And here I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; He tugged at his coat pocket and flung a
thin volume on the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a book, by a poet.&nbsp;
Read it and keep it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, in reply to Martin&rsquo;s
protest: &ldquo;What have I to do with books?&nbsp; I had another hemorrhage
this morning.&nbsp; Got any whiskey?&nbsp; No, of course not.&nbsp;
Wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was off and away.&nbsp; Martin watched his long figure go down
the outside steps, and, on turning to close the gate, noted with a pang
the shoulders, which had once been broad, drawn in now over, the collapsed
ruin of the chest.&nbsp; Martin got two tumblers, and fell to reading
the book of verse, Henry Vaughn Marlow&rsquo;s latest collection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Scotch,&rdquo; Brissenden announced on his return.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The beggar sells nothing but American whiskey.&nbsp; But here&rsquo;s
a quart of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send one of the youngsters for lemons, and we&rsquo;ll
make a toddy,&rdquo; Martin offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what a book like that will earn Marlow?&rdquo; he
went on, holding up the volume in question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly fifty dollars,&rdquo; came the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though
he&rsquo;s lucky if he pulls even on it, or if he can inveigle a publisher
to risk bringing it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then one can&rsquo;t make a living out of poetry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin&rsquo;s tone and face alike showed his dejection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&nbsp; What fool expects to?&nbsp; Out of rhyming,
yes.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Bruce, and Virginia Spring, and Sedgwick.&nbsp;
They do very nicely.&nbsp; But poetry&mdash;do you know how Vaughn Marlow
makes his living?&mdash;teaching in a boys&rsquo; cramming-joint down
in Pennsylvania, and of all private little hells such a billet is the
limit.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t trade places with him if he had fifty
years of life before him.&nbsp; And yet his work stands out from the
ruck of the contemporary versifiers as a balas ruby among carrots.&nbsp;
And the reviews he gets!&nbsp; Damn them, all of them, the crass manikins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much is written by the men who can&rsquo;t write about
the men who do write,&rdquo; Martin concurred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I was
appalled at the quantities of rubbish written about Stevenson and his
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghouls and harpies!&rdquo; Brissenden snapped out with clicking
teeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I know the spawn&mdash;complacently pecking
at him for his Father Damien letter, analyzing him, weighing him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Measuring him by the yardstick of their own miserable egos,&rdquo;
Martin broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it, a good phrase,&mdash;mouthing and besliming
the True, and Beautiful, and Good, and finally patting him on the back
and saying, &lsquo;Good dog, Fido.&rsquo;&nbsp; Faugh!&nbsp; &lsquo;The
little chattering daws of men,&rsquo; Richard Realf called them the
night he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pecking at star-dust,&rdquo; Martin took up the strain warmly;
&ldquo;at the meteoric flight of the master-men.&nbsp; I once wrote
a squib on them&mdash;the critics, or the reviewers, rather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see it,&rdquo; Brissenden begged eagerly.</p>
<p>So Martin unearthed a carbon copy of &ldquo;Star-dust,&rdquo; and
during the reading of it Brissenden chuckled, rubbed his hands, and
forgot to sip his toddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strikes me you&rsquo;re a bit of star-dust yourself, flung
into a world of cowled gnomes who cannot see,&rdquo; was his comment
at the end of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course it was snapped up by the first
magazine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin ran over the pages of his manuscript book.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
has been refused by twenty-seven of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brissenden essayed a long and hearty laugh, but broke down in a fit
of coughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you needn&rsquo;t tell me you haven&rsquo;t tackled poetry,&rdquo;
he gasped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me see some of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t read it now,&rdquo; Martin pleaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
want to talk with you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make up a bundle and you can
take it home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brissenden departed with the &ldquo;Love-cycle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Peri and the Pearl,&rdquo; returning next day to greet Martin with:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only did he assure Martin that he was a poet, but Martin learned
that Brissenden also was one.&nbsp; He was swept off his feet by the
other&rsquo;s work, and astounded that no attempt had been made to publish
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A plague on all their houses!&rdquo; was Brissenden&rsquo;s
answer to Martin&rsquo;s volunteering to market his work for him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Love Beauty for its own sake,&rdquo; was his counsel, &ldquo;and
leave the magazines alone.&nbsp; Back to your ships and your sea&mdash;that&rsquo;s
my advice to you, Martin Eden.&nbsp; What do you want in these sick
and rotten cities of men?&nbsp; You are cutting your throat every day
you waste in them trying to prostitute beauty to the needs of magazinedom.&nbsp;
What was it you quoted me the other day?&mdash;Oh, yes, &lsquo;Man,
the latest of the ephemera.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, what do you, the latest
of the ephemera, want with fame?&nbsp; If you got it, it would be poison
to you.&nbsp; You are too simple, too elemental, and too rational, by
my faith, to prosper on such pap.&nbsp; I hope you never do sell a line
to the magazines.&nbsp; Beauty is the only master to serve.&nbsp; Serve
her and damn the multitude!&nbsp; Success!&nbsp; What in hell&rsquo;s
success if it isn&rsquo;t right there in your Stevenson sonnet, which
outranks Henley&rsquo;s &lsquo;Apparition,&rsquo; in that &lsquo;Love-cycle,&rsquo;
in those sea-poems?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not in what you succeed in doing that you get your joy,
but in the doing of it.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t tell me.&nbsp; I know
it.&nbsp; You know it.&nbsp; Beauty hurts you.&nbsp; It is an everlasting
pain in you, a wound that does not heal, a knife of flame.&nbsp; Why
should you palter with magazines?&nbsp; Let beauty be your end.&nbsp;
Why should you mint beauty into gold?&nbsp; Anyway, you can&rsquo;t;
so there&rsquo;s no use in my getting excited over it.&nbsp; You can
read the magazines for a thousand years and you won&rsquo;t find the
value of one line of Keats.&nbsp; Leave fame and coin alone, sign away
on a ship to-morrow, and go back to your sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for fame, but for love,&rdquo; Martin laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Love
seems to have no place in your Cosmos; in mine, Beauty is the handmaiden
of Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brissenden looked at him pityingly and admiringly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are so young, Martin boy, so young.&nbsp; You will flutter high, but
your wings are of the finest gauze, dusted with the fairest pigments.&nbsp;
Do not scorch them.&nbsp; But of course you have scorched them already.&nbsp;
It required some glorified petticoat to account for that &lsquo;Love-cycle,&rsquo;
and that&rsquo;s the shame of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It glorifies love as well as the petticoat,&rdquo; Martin
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The philosophy of madness,&rdquo; was the retort.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
have I assured myself when wandering in hasheesh dreams.&nbsp; But beware.&nbsp;
These bourgeois cities will kill you.&nbsp; Look at that den of traitors
where I met you.&nbsp; Dry rot is no name for it.&nbsp; One can&rsquo;t
keep his sanity in such an atmosphere.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s degrading.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s not one of them who is not degrading, man and woman, all
of them animated stomachs guided by the high intellectual and artistic
impulses of clams&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off suddenly and regarded Martin.&nbsp; Then, with a flash
of divination, he saw the situation.&nbsp; The expression on his face
turned to wondering horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you wrote that tremendous &lsquo;Love-cycle&rsquo; to
her&mdash;that pale, shrivelled, female thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant Martin&rsquo;s right hand had shot to a throttling
clutch on his throat, and he was being shaken till his teeth rattled.&nbsp;
But Martin, looking into his eyes, saw no fear there,&mdash;naught but
a curious and mocking devil.&nbsp; Martin remembered himself, and flung
Brissenden, by the neck, sidelong upon the bed, at the same moment releasing
his hold.</p>
<p>Brissenden panted and gasped painfully for a moment, then began to
chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had made me eternally your debtor had you shaken out the
flame,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My nerves are on a hair-trigger these days,&rdquo; Martin
apologized.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hope I didn&rsquo;t hurt you.&nbsp; Here, let
me mix a fresh toddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you young Greek!&rdquo; Brissenden went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wonder if you take just pride in that body of yours.&nbsp; You are devilish
strong.&nbsp; You are a young panther, a lion cub.&nbsp; Well, well,
it is you who must pay for that strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Martin asked curiously, passing aim
a glass.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, down this and be good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; Brissenden sipped his toddy and smiled
appreciation of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because of the women.&nbsp; They will
worry you until you die, as they have already worried you, or else I
was born yesterday.&nbsp; Now there&rsquo;s no use in your choking me;
I&rsquo;m going to have my say.&nbsp; This is undoubtedly your calf
love; but for Beauty&rsquo;s sake show better taste next time.&nbsp;
What under heaven do you want with a daughter of the bourgeoisie?&nbsp;
Leave them alone.&nbsp; Pick out some great, wanton flame of a woman,
who laughs at life and jeers at death and loves one while she may.&nbsp;
There are such women, and they will love you just as readily as any
pusillanimous product of bourgeois sheltered life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pusillanimous?&rdquo; Martin protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, pusillanimous; prattling out little moralities that
have been prattled into them, and afraid to live life.&nbsp; They will
love you, Martin, but they will love their little moralities more.&nbsp;
What you want is the magnificent abandon of life, the great free souls,
the blazing butterflies and not the little gray moths.&nbsp; Oh, you
will grow tired of them, too, of all the female things, if you are unlucky
enough to live.&nbsp; But you won&rsquo;t live.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t
go back to your ships and sea; therefore, you&rsquo;ll hang around these
pest-holes of cities until your bones are rotten, and then you&rsquo;ll
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can lecture me, but you can&rsquo;t make me talk back,&rdquo;
Martin said.&nbsp; &ldquo;After all, you have but the wisdom of your
temperament, and the wisdom of my temperament is just as unimpeachable
as yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They disagreed about love, and the magazines, and many things, but
they liked each other, and on Martin&rsquo;s part it was no less than
a profound liking.&nbsp; Day after day they were together, if for no
more than the hour Brissenden spent in Martin&rsquo;s stuffy room.&nbsp;
Brissenden never arrived without his quart of whiskey, and when they
dined together down-town, he drank Scotch and soda throughout the meal.&nbsp;
He invariably paid the way for both, and it was through him that Martin
learned the refinements of food, drank his first champagne, and made
acquaintance with Rhenish wines.</p>
<p>But Brissenden was always an enigma.&nbsp; With the face of an ascetic,
he was, in all the failing blood of him, a frank voluptuary.&nbsp; He
was unafraid to die, bitter and cynical of all the ways of living; and
yet, dying, he loved life, to the last atom of it.&nbsp; He was possessed
by a madness to live, to thrill, &ldquo;to squirm my little space in
the cosmic dust whence I came,&rdquo; as he phrased it once himself.&nbsp;
He had tampered with drugs and done many strange things in quest of
new thrills, new sensations.&nbsp; As he told Martin, he had once gone
three days without water, had done so voluntarily, in order to experience
the exquisite delight of such a thirst assuaged.&nbsp; Who or what he
was, Martin never learned.&nbsp; He was a man without a past, whose
future was the imminent grave and whose present was a bitter fever of
living.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<p>Martin was steadily losing his battle.&nbsp; Economize as he would,
the earnings from hack-work did not balance expenses.&nbsp; Thanksgiving
found him with his black suit in pawn and unable to accept the Morses&rsquo;
invitation to dinner.&nbsp; Ruth was not made happy by his reason for
not coming, and the corresponding effect on him was one of desperation.&nbsp;
He told her that he would come, after all; that he would go over to
San Francisco, to the <i>Transcontinental</i> office, collect the five
dollars due him, and with it redeem his suit of clothes.</p>
<p>In the morning he borrowed ten cents from Maria.&nbsp; He would have
borrowed it, by preference, from Brissenden, but that erratic individual
had disappeared.&nbsp; Two weeks had passed since Martin had seen him,
and he vainly cudgelled his brains for some cause of offence.&nbsp;
The ten cents carried Martin across the ferry to San Francisco, and
as he walked up Market Street he speculated upon his predicament in
case he failed to collect the money.&nbsp; There would then be no way
for him to return to Oakland, and he knew no one in San Francisco from
whom to borrow another ten cents.</p>
<p>The door to the <i>Transcontinental</i> office was ajar, and Martin,
in the act of opening it, was brought to a sudden pause by a loud voice
from within, which exclaimed:- &ldquo;But that is not the question,
Mr. Ford.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Ford, Martin knew, from his correspondence,
to be the editor&rsquo;s name.)&nbsp; &ldquo;The question is, are you
prepared to pay?&mdash;cash, and cash down, I mean?&nbsp; I am not interested
in the prospects of the <i>Transcontinental</i> and what you expect
to make it next year.&nbsp; What I want is to be paid for what I do.&nbsp;
And I tell you, right now, the Christmas <i>Transcontinental</i> don&rsquo;t
go to press till I have the money in my hand.&nbsp; Good day.&nbsp;
When you get the money, come and see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door jerked open, and the man flung past Martin, with an angry
countenance and went down the corridor, muttering curses and clenching
his fists.&nbsp; Martin decided not to enter immediately, and lingered
in the hallways for a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; Then he shoved the door
open and walked in.&nbsp; It was a new experience, the first time he
had been inside an editorial office.&nbsp; Cards evidently were not
necessary in that office, for the boy carried word to an inner room
that there was a man who wanted to see Mr. Ford.&nbsp; Returning, the
boy beckoned him from halfway across the room and led him to the private
office, the editorial sanctum.&nbsp; Martin&rsquo;s first impression
was of the disorder and cluttered confusion of the room.&nbsp; Next
he noticed a bewhiskered, youthful-looking man, sitting at a roll-top
desk, who regarded him curiously.&nbsp; Martin marvelled at the calm
repose of his face.&nbsp; It was evident that the squabble with the
printer had not affected his equanimity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I am Martin Eden,&rdquo; Martin began the conversation.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;And I want my five dollars,&rdquo; was what he would have liked
to say.)</p>
<p>But this was his first editor, and under the circumstances he did
not desire to scare him too abruptly.&nbsp; To his surprise, Mr. Ford
leaped into the air with a &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; and
the next moment, with both hands, was shaking Martin&rsquo;s hand effusively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say how glad I am to see you, Mr. Eden.&nbsp;
Often wondered what you were like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he held Martin off at arm&rsquo;s length and ran his beaming
eyes over Martin&rsquo;s second-best suit, which was also his worst
suit, and which was ragged and past repair, though the trousers showed
the careful crease he had put in with Maria&rsquo;s flat-irons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess, though, I conceived you to be a much older man
than you are.&nbsp; Your story, you know, showed such breadth, and vigor,
such maturity and depth of thought.&nbsp; A masterpiece, that story&mdash;I
knew it when I had read the first half-dozen lines.&nbsp; Let me tell
you how I first read it.&nbsp; But no; first let me introduce you to
the staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still talking, Mr. Ford led him into the general office, where he
introduced him to the associate editor, Mr. White, a slender, frail
little man whose hand seemed strangely cold, as if he were suffering
from a chill, and whose whiskers were sparse and silky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Ends, Mr. Eden.&nbsp; Mr. Ends is our business manager,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin found himself shaking hands with a cranky-eyed, bald-headed
man, whose face looked youthful enough from what little could be seen
of it, for most of it was covered by a snow-white beard, carefully trimmed&mdash;by
his wife, who did it on Sundays, at which times she also shaved the
back of his neck.</p>
<p>The three men surrounded Martin, all talking admiringly and at once,
until it seemed to him that they were talking against time for a wager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We often wondered why you didn&rsquo;t call,&rdquo; Mr. White
was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have the carfare, and I live across the Bay,&rdquo;
Martin answered bluntly, with the idea of showing them his imperative
need for the money.</p>
<p>Surely, he thought to himself, my glad rags in themselves are eloquent
advertisement of my need.&nbsp; Time and again, whenever opportunity
offered, he hinted about the purpose of his business.&nbsp; But his
admirers&rsquo; ears were deaf.&nbsp; They sang his praises, told him
what they had thought of his story at first sight, what they subsequently
thought, what their wives and families thought; but not one hint did
they breathe of intention to pay him for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I tell you how I first read your story?&rdquo; Mr. Ford
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I was coming west
from New York, and when the train stopped at Ogden, the train-boy on
the new run brought aboard the current number of the <i>Transcontinental</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My God! Martin thought; you can travel in a Pullman while I starve
for the paltry five dollars you owe me.&nbsp; A wave of anger rushed
over him.&nbsp; The wrong done him by the <i>Transcontinental</i> loomed
colossal, for strong upon him were all the dreary months of vain yearning,
of hunger and privation, and his present hunger awoke and gnawed at
him, reminding him that he had eaten nothing since the day before, and
little enough then.&nbsp; For the moment he saw red.&nbsp; These creatures
were not even robbers.&nbsp; They were sneak-thieves.&nbsp; By lies
and broken promises they had tricked him out of his story.&nbsp; Well,
he would show them.&nbsp; And a great resolve surged into his will to
the effect that he would not leave the office until he got his money.&nbsp;
He remembered, if he did not get it, that there was no way for him to
go back to Oakland.&nbsp; He controlled himself with an effort, but
not before the wolfish expression of his face had awed and perturbed
them.</p>
<p>They became more voluble than ever.&nbsp; Mr. Ford started anew to
tell how he had first read &ldquo;The Ring of Bells,&rdquo; and Mr.
Ends at the same time was striving to repeat his niece&rsquo;s appreciation
of &ldquo;The Ring of Bells,&rdquo; said niece being a school-teacher
in Alameda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I came for,&rdquo; Martin said finally.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To be paid for that story all of you like so well.&nbsp; Five
dollars, I believe, is what you promised me would be paid on publication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ford, with an expression on his mobile features of mediate and
happy acquiescence, started to reach for his pocket, then turned suddenly
to Mr. Ends, and said that he had left his money home.&nbsp; That Mr.
Ends resented this, was patent; and Martin saw the twitch of his arm
as if to protect his trousers pocket.&nbsp; Martin knew that the money
was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Mr. Ends, &ldquo;but I paid the printer
not an hour ago, and he took my ready change.&nbsp; It was careless
of me to be so short; but the bill was not yet due, and the printer&rsquo;s
request, as a favor, to make an immediate advance, was quite unexpected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both men looked expectantly at Mr. White, but that gentleman laughed
and shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; His conscience was clean at any rate.&nbsp;
He had come into the <i>Transcontinental</i> to learn magazine-literature,
instead of which he had principally learned finance.&nbsp; The <i>Transcontinental</i>
owed him four months&rsquo; salary, and he knew that the printer must
be appeased before the associate editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather absurd, Mr. Eden, to have caught us in this
shape,&rdquo; Mr. Ford preambled airily.&nbsp; &ldquo;All carelessness,
I assure you.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll mail you a check the first thing in the morning.&nbsp; You
have Mr. Eden&rsquo;s address, haven&rsquo;t you, Mr. Ends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, Mr. Ends had the address, and the check would be mailed the
first thing in the morning.&nbsp; Martin&rsquo;s knowledge of banks
and checks was hazy, but he could see no reason why they should not
give him the check on this day just as well as on the next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is understood, Mr. Eden, that we&rsquo;ll mail you
the check to-morrow?&rdquo; Mr. Ford said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need the money to-day,&rdquo; Martin answered stolidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The unfortunate circumstances&mdash;if you had chanced here
any other day,&rdquo; Mr. Ford began suavely, only to be interrupted
by Mr. Ends, whose cranky eyes justified themselves in his shortness
of temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ford has already explained the situation,&rdquo; he said
with asperity.&nbsp; &ldquo;And so have I.&nbsp; The check will be mailed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also have explained,&rdquo; Martin broke in, &ldquo;and
I have explained that I want the money to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had felt his pulse quicken a trifle at the business manager&rsquo;s
brusqueness, and upon him he kept an alert eye, for it was in that gentleman&rsquo;s
trousers pocket that he divined the <i>Transcontinental&rsquo;s</i>
ready cash was reposing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too bad&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Ford began.</p>
<p>But at that moment, with an impatient movement, Mr. Ends turned as
if about to leave the room.&nbsp; At the same instant Martin sprang
for him, clutching him by the throat with one hand in such fashion that
Mr. Ends&rsquo; snow-white beard, still maintaining its immaculate trimness,
pointed ceilingward at an angle of forty-five degrees.&nbsp; To the
horror of Mr. White and Mr. Ford, they saw their business manager shaken
like an Astrakhan rug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dig up, you venerable discourager of rising young talent!&rdquo;
Martin exhorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dig up, or I&rsquo;ll shake it out of
you, even if it&rsquo;s all in nickels.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, to the two
affrighted onlookers: &ldquo;Keep away!&nbsp; If you interfere, somebody&rsquo;s
liable to get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ends was choking, and it was not until the grip on his throat
was eased that he was able to signify his acquiescence in the digging-up
programme.&nbsp; All together, after repeated digs, its trousers pocket
yielded four dollars and fifteen cents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside out with it,&rdquo; Martin commanded.</p>
<p>An additional ten cents fell out.&nbsp; Martin counted the result
of his raid a second time to make sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You next!&rdquo; he shouted at Mr. Ford.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want
seventy-five cents more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ford did not wait, but ransacked his pockets, with the result
of sixty cents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure that is all?&rdquo; Martin demanded menacingly, possessing
himself of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;What have you got in your vest pockets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In token of his good faith, Mr. Ford turned two of his pockets inside
out.&nbsp; A strip of cardboard fell to the floor from one of them.&nbsp;
He recovered it and was in the act of returning it, when Martin cried:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&mdash;A ferry ticket?&nbsp; Here, give
it to me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s worth ten cents.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll credit
you with it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve now got four dollars and ninety-five cents,
including the ticket.&nbsp; Five cents is still due me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked fiercely at Mr. White, and found that fragile creature
in the act of handing him a nickel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Martin said, addressing them collectively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wish you a good day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robber!&rdquo; Mr. Ends snarled after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sneak-thief!&rdquo; Martin retorted, slamming the door as
he passed out.</p>
<p>Martin was elated&mdash;so elated that when he recollected that <i>The
Hornet</i> owed him fifteen dollars for &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl,&rdquo;
he decided forthwith to go and collect it.&nbsp; But <i>The Hornet</i>
was run by a set of clean-shaven, strapping young men, frank buccaneers
who robbed everything and everybody, not excepting one another.&nbsp;
After some breakage of the office furniture, the editor (an ex-college
athlete), ably assisted by the business manager, an advertising agent,
and the porter, succeeded in removing Martin from the office and in
accelerating, by initial impulse, his descent of the first flight of
stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come again, Mr. Eden; glad to see you any time,&rdquo; they
laughed down at him from the landing above.</p>
<p>Martin grinned as he picked himself up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; he murmured back.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <i>Transcontinental</i>
crowd were nanny-goats, but you fellows are a lot of prize-fighters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More laughter greeted this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say, Mr. Eden,&rdquo; the editor of <i>The Hornet</i>
called down, &ldquo;that for a poet you can go some yourself.&nbsp;
Where did you learn that right cross&mdash;if I may ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you learned that half-Nelson,&rdquo; Martin answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Anyway, you&rsquo;re going to have a black eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope your neck doesn&rsquo;t stiffen up,&rdquo; the editor
wished solicitously: &ldquo;What do you say we all go out and have a
drink on it&mdash;not the neck, of course, but the little rough-house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go you if I lose,&rdquo; Martin accepted.</p>
<p>And robbers and robbed drank together, amicably agreeing that the
battle was to the strong, and that the fifteen dollars for &ldquo;The
Peri and the Pearl&rdquo; belonged by right to <i>The Hornet&rsquo;s</i>
editorial staff.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<p>Arthur remained at the gate while Ruth climbed Maria&rsquo;s front
steps.&nbsp; She heard the rapid click of the type-writer, and when
Martin let her in, found him on the last page of a manuscript.&nbsp;
She had come to make certain whether or not he would be at their table
for Thanksgiving dinner; but before she could broach the subject Martin
plunged into the one with which he was full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, let me read you this,&rdquo; he cried, separating the
carbon copies and running the pages of manuscript into shape.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my latest, and different from anything I&rsquo;ve
done.&nbsp; It is so altogether different that I am almost afraid of
it, and yet I&rsquo;ve a sneaking idea it is good.&nbsp; You be judge.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s an Hawaiian story.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve called it &lsquo;Wiki-wiki.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face was bright with the creative glow, though she shivered in
the cold room and had been struck by the coldness of his hands at greeting.&nbsp;
She listened closely while he read, and though he from time to time
had seen only disapprobation in her face, at the close he asked:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, what do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she, answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will
it&mdash;do you think it will sell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; was the confession.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
too strong for the magazines.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s true, on my word
it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you persist in writing such things when you know
they won&rsquo;t sell?&rdquo; she went on inexorably.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
reason for your writing is to make a living, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right; but the miserable story got away
with me.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t help writing it.&nbsp; It demanded to
be written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that character, that Wiki-Wiki, why do you make him talk
so roughly?&nbsp; Surely it will offend your readers, and surely that
is why the editors are justified in refusing your work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the real Wiki-Wiki would have talked that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is not good taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is life,&rdquo; he replied bluntly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
real.&nbsp; It is true.&nbsp; And I must write life as I see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no answer, and for an awkward moment they sat silent.&nbsp;
It was because he loved her that he did not quite understand her, and
she could not understand him because he was so large that he bulked
beyond her horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve collected from the <i>Transcontinental</i>,&rdquo;
he said in an effort to shift the conversation to a more comfortable
subject.&nbsp; The picture of the bewhiskered trio, as he had last seen
them, mulcted of four dollars and ninety cents and a ferry ticket, made
him chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll come!&rdquo; she cried joyously.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
was what I came to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come?&rdquo; he muttered absently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to dinner to-morrow.&nbsp; You know you said you&rsquo;d
recover your suit if you got that money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot all about it,&rdquo; he said humbly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
see, this morning the poundman got Maria&rsquo;s two cows and the baby
calf, and&mdash;well, it happened that Maria didn&rsquo;t have any money,
and so I had to recover her cows for her.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where the
<i>Transcontinental</i> fiver went&mdash;&lsquo;The Ring of Bells&rsquo;
went into the poundman&rsquo;s pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked down at his clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears of disappointment and reproach glistened in her blue eyes,
but she said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next Thanksgiving you&rsquo;ll have dinner with me in Delmonico&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
he said cheerily; &ldquo;or in London, or Paris, or anywhere you wish.&nbsp;
I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw in the paper a few days ago,&rdquo; she announced abruptly,
&ldquo;that there had been several local appointments to the Railway
Mail.&nbsp; You passed first, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was compelled to admit that the call had come for him, but that
he had declined it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was so sure&mdash;I am so sure&mdash;of
myself,&rdquo; he concluded.&nbsp; &ldquo;A year from now I&rsquo;ll
be earning more than a dozen men in the Railway Mail.&nbsp; You wait
and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; was all she said, when he finished.&nbsp; She stood
up, pulling at her gloves.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must go, Martin.&nbsp; Arthur
is waiting for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her in his arms and kissed her, but she proved a passive
sweetheart.&nbsp; There was no tenseness in her body, her arms did not
go around him, and her lips met his without their wonted pressure.</p>
<p>She was angry with him, he concluded, as he returned from the gate.&nbsp;
But why?&nbsp; It was unfortunate that the poundman had gobbled Maria&rsquo;s
cows.&nbsp; But it was only a stroke of fate.&nbsp; Nobody could be
blamed for it.&nbsp; Nor did it enter his head that he could have done
aught otherwise than what he had done.&nbsp; Well, yes, he was to blame
a little, was his next thought, for having refused the call to the Railway
Mail.&nbsp; And she had not liked &ldquo;Wiki-Wiki.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned at the head of the steps to meet the letter-carrier on
his afternoon round.&nbsp; The ever recurrent fever of expectancy assailed
Martin as he took the bundle of long envelopes.&nbsp; One was not long.&nbsp;
It was short and thin, and outside was printed the address of <i>The
New York Outview</i>.&nbsp; He paused in the act of tearing the envelope
open.&nbsp; It could not be an acceptance.&nbsp; He had no manuscripts
with that publication.&nbsp; Perhaps&mdash;his heart almost stood still
at the&mdash;wild thought&mdash;perhaps they were ordering an article
from him; but the next instant he dismissed the surmise as hopelessly
impossible.</p>
<p>It was a short, formal letter, signed by the office editor, merely
informing him that an anonymous letter which they had received was enclosed,
and that he could rest assured the <i>Outview&rsquo;s</i> staff never
under any circumstances gave consideration to anonymous correspondence.</p>
<p>The enclosed letter Martin found to be crudely printed by hand.&nbsp;
It was a hotchpotch of illiterate abuse of Martin, and of assertion
that the &ldquo;so-called Martin Eden&rdquo; who was selling stories
to magazines was no writer at all, and that in reality he was stealing
stories from old magazines, typing them, and sending them out as his
own.&nbsp; The envelope was postmarked &ldquo;San Leandro.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Martin did not require a second thought to discover the author.&nbsp;
Higginbotham&rsquo;s grammar, Higginbotham&rsquo;s colloquialisms, Higginbotham&rsquo;s
mental quirks and processes, were apparent throughout.&nbsp; Martin
saw in every line, not the fine Italian hand, but the coarse grocer&rsquo;s
fist, of his brother-in-law.</p>
<p>But why? he vainly questioned.&nbsp; What injury had he done Bernard
Higginbotham?&nbsp; The thing was so unreasonable, so wanton.&nbsp;
There was no explaining it.&nbsp; In the course of the week a dozen
similar letters were forwarded to Martin by the editors of various Eastern
magazines.&nbsp; The editors were behaving handsomely, Martin concluded.&nbsp;
He was wholly unknown to them, yet some of them had even been sympathetic.&nbsp;
It was evident that they detested anonymity.&nbsp; He saw that the malicious
attempt to hurt him had failed.&nbsp; In fact, if anything came of it,
it was bound to be good, for at least his name had been called to the
attention of a number of editors.&nbsp; Sometime, perhaps, reading a
submitted manuscript of his, they might remember him as the fellow about
whom they had received an anonymous letter.&nbsp; And who was to say
that such a remembrance might not sway the balance of their judgment
just a trifle in his favor?</p>
<p>It was about this time that Martin took a great slump in Maria&rsquo;s
estimation.&nbsp; He found her in the kitchen one morning groaning with
pain, tears of weakness running down her cheeks, vainly endeavoring
to put through a large ironing.&nbsp; He promptly diagnosed her affliction
as La Grippe, dosed her with hot whiskey (the remnants in the bottles
for which Brissenden was responsible), and ordered her to bed.&nbsp;
But Maria was refractory.&nbsp; The ironing had to be done, she protested,
and delivered that night, or else there would be no food on the morrow
for the seven small and hungry Silvas.</p>
<p>To her astonishment (and it was something that she never ceased from
relating to her dying day), she saw Martin Eden seize an iron from the
stove and throw a fancy shirt-waist on the ironing-board.&nbsp; It was
Kate Flanagan&rsquo;s best Sunday waist, than whom there was no more
exacting and fastidiously dressed woman in Maria&rsquo;s world.&nbsp;
Also, Miss Flanagan had sent special instruction that said waist must
be delivered by that night.&nbsp; As every one knew, she was keeping
company with John Collins, the blacksmith, and, as Maria knew privily,
Miss Flanagan and Mr. Collins were going next day to Golden Gate Park.&nbsp;
Vain was Maria&rsquo;s attempt to rescue the garment.&nbsp; Martin guided
her tottering footsteps to a chair, from where she watched him with
bulging eyes.&nbsp; In a quarter of the time it would have taken her
she saw the shirt-waist safely ironed, and ironed as well as she could
have done it, as Martin made her grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could work faster,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;if your irons
were only hotter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her, the irons he swung were much hotter than she ever dared to
use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sprinkling is all wrong,&rdquo; he complained next.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here, let me teach you how to sprinkle.&nbsp; Pressure is what&rsquo;s
wanted.&nbsp; Sprinkle under pressure if you want to iron fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He procured a packing-case from the woodpile in the cellar, fitted
a cover to it, and raided the scrap-iron the Silva tribe was collecting
for the junkman.&nbsp; With fresh-sprinkled garments in the box, covered
with the board and pressed by the iron, the device was complete and
in operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you watch me, Maria,&rdquo; he said, stripping off to
his undershirt and gripping an iron that was what he called &ldquo;really
hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; when he feenish da iron&rsquo; he washa da wools,&rdquo;
as she described it afterward.&nbsp; &ldquo;He say, &lsquo;Maria, you
are da greata fool.&nbsp; I showa you how to washa da wools,&rsquo;
an&rsquo; he shows me, too.&nbsp; Ten minutes he maka da machine&mdash;one
barrel, one wheel-hub, two poles, justa like dat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin had learned the contrivance from Joe at the Shelly Hot Springs.&nbsp;
The old wheel-hub, fixed on the end of the upright pole, constituted
the plunger.&nbsp; Making this, in turn, fast to the spring-pole attached
to the kitchen rafters, so that the hub played upon the woollens in
the barrel, he was able, with one hand, thoroughly to pound them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more Maria washa da wools,&rdquo; her story always ended.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I maka da kids worka da pole an&rsquo; da hub an&rsquo; da barrel.&nbsp;
Him da smarta man, Mister Eden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, by his masterly operation and improvement of her kitchen-laundry
he fell an immense distance in her regard.&nbsp; The glamour of romance
with which her imagination had invested him faded away in the cold light
of fact that he was an ex-laundryman.&nbsp; All his books, and his grand
friends who visited him in carriages or with countless bottles of whiskey,
went for naught.&nbsp; He was, after all, a mere workingman, a member
of her own class and caste.&nbsp; He was more human and approachable,
but, he was no longer mystery.</p>
<p>Martin&rsquo;s alienation from his family continued.&nbsp; Following
upon Mr. Higginbotham&rsquo;s unprovoked attack, Mr. Hermann von Schmidt
showed his hand.&nbsp; The fortunate sale of several storiettes, some
humorous verse, and a few jokes gave Martin a temporary splurge of prosperity.&nbsp;
Not only did he partially pay up his bills, but he had sufficient balance
left to redeem his black suit and wheel.&nbsp; The latter, by virtue
of a twisted crank-hanger, required repairing, and, as a matter of friendliness
with his future brother-in-law, he sent it to Von Schmidt&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>The afternoon of the same day Martin was pleased by the wheel being
delivered by a small boy.&nbsp; Von Schmidt was also inclined to be
friendly, was Martin&rsquo;s conclusion from this unusual favor.&nbsp;
Repaired wheels usually had to be called for.&nbsp; But when he examined
the wheel, he discovered no repairs had been made.&nbsp; A little later
in the day he telephoned his sister&rsquo;s betrothed, and learned that
that person didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with him in &ldquo;any
shape, manner, or form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hermann von Schmidt,&rdquo; Martin answered cheerfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
a good mind to come over and punch that Dutch nose of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come to my shop,&rdquo; came the reply, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll send for the police.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll put you through,
too.&nbsp; Oh, I know you, but you can&rsquo;t make no rough-house with
me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want nothin&rsquo; to do with the likes of you.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re a loafer, that&rsquo;s what, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t asleep.&nbsp;
You ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to do no spongin&rsquo; off me just because
I&rsquo;m marryin&rsquo; your sister.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you go to
work an&rsquo; earn an honest livin&rsquo;, eh?&nbsp; Answer me that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin&rsquo;s philosophy asserted itself, dissipating his anger,
and he hung up the receiver with a long whistle of incredulous amusement.&nbsp;
But after the amusement came the reaction, and he was oppressed by his
loneliness.&nbsp; Nobody understood him, nobody seemed to have any use
for him, except Brissenden, and Brissenden had disappeared, God alone
knew where.</p>
<p>Twilight was falling as Martin left the fruit store and turned homeward,
his marketing on his arm.&nbsp; At the corner an electric car had stopped,
and at sight of a lean, familiar figure alighting, his heart leapt with
joy.&nbsp; It was Brissenden, and in the fleeting glimpse, ere the car
started up, Martin noted the overcoat pockets, one bulging with books,
the other bulging with a quart bottle of whiskey.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<p>Brissenden gave no explanation of his long absence, nor did Martin
pry into it.&nbsp; He was content to see his friend&rsquo;s cadaverous
face opposite him through the steam rising from a tumbler of toddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too, have not been idle,&rdquo; Brissenden proclaimed,
after hearing Martin&rsquo;s account of the work he had accomplished.</p>
<p>He pulled a manuscript from his inside coat pocket and passed it
to Martin, who looked at the title and glanced up curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Brissenden laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pretty
good title, eh?&nbsp; &lsquo;Ephemera&rsquo;&mdash;it is the one word.&nbsp;
And you&rsquo;re responsible for it, what of your <i>man</i>, who is
always the erected, the vitalized inorganic, the latest of the ephemera,
the creature of temperature strutting his little space on the thermometer.&nbsp;
It got into my head and I had to write it to get rid of it.&nbsp; Tell
me what you think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin&rsquo;s face, flushed at first, paled as he read on.&nbsp;
It was perfect art.&nbsp; Form triumphed over substance, if triumph
it could be called where the last conceivable atom of substance had
found expression in so perfect construction as to make Martin&rsquo;s
head swim with delight, to put passionate tears into his eyes, and to
send chills creeping up and down his back.&nbsp; It was a long poem
of six or seven hundred lines, and it was a fantastic, amazing, unearthly
thing.&nbsp; It was terrific, impossible; and yet there it was, scrawled
in black ink across the sheets of paper.&nbsp; It dealt with man and
his soul-gropings in their ultimate terms, plumbing the abysses of space
for the testimony of remotest suns and rainbow spectrums.&nbsp; It was
a mad orgy of imagination, wassailing in the skull of a dying man who
half sobbed under his breath and was quick with the wild flutter of
fading heart-beats.&nbsp; The poem swung in majestic rhythm to the cool
tumult of interstellar conflict, to the onset of starry hosts, to the
impact of cold suns and the flaming up of nebulae in the darkened void;
and through it all, unceasing and faint, like a silver shuttle, ran
the frail, piping voice of man, a querulous chirp amid the screaming
of planets and the crash of systems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing like it in literature,&rdquo; Martin said,
when at last he was able to speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful!&mdash;wonderful!&nbsp;
It has gone to my head.&nbsp; I am drunken with it.&nbsp; That great,
infinitesimal question&mdash;I can&rsquo;t shake it out of my thoughts.&nbsp;
That questing, eternal, ever recurring, thin little wailing voice of
man is still ringing in my ears.&nbsp; It is like the dead-march of
a gnat amid the trumpeting of elephants and the roaring of lions.&nbsp;
It is insatiable with microscopic desire.&nbsp; I now I&rsquo;m making
a fool of myself, but the thing has obsessed me.&nbsp; You are&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know what you are&mdash;you are wonderful, that&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; But how do you do it?&nbsp; How do you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin paused from his rhapsody, only to break out afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never write again.&nbsp; I am a dauber in clay.&nbsp;
You have shown me the work of the real artificer-artisan.&nbsp; Genius!&nbsp;
This is something more than genius.&nbsp; It transcends genius.&nbsp;
It is truth gone mad.&nbsp; It is true, man, every line of it.&nbsp;
I wonder if you realize that, you dogmatist.&nbsp; Science cannot give
you the lie.&nbsp; It is the truth of the sneer, stamped out from the
black iron of the Cosmos and interwoven with mighty rhythms of sound
into a fabric of splendor and beauty.&nbsp; And now I won&rsquo;t say
another word.&nbsp; I am overwhelmed, crushed.&nbsp; Yes, I will, too.&nbsp;
Let me market it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brissenden grinned.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a magazine in
Christendom that would dare to publish it&mdash;you know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of the sort.&nbsp; I know there&rsquo;s not
a magazine in Christendom that wouldn&rsquo;t jump at it.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t get things like that every day.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s no mere
poem of the year.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the poem of the century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to take you up on the proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t get cynical,&rdquo; Martin exhorted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The magazine editors are not wholly fatuous.&nbsp; I know that.&nbsp;
And I&rsquo;ll close with you on the bet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wager anything
you want that &lsquo;Ephemera&rsquo; is accepted either on the first
or second offering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one thing that prevents me from taking
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brissenden waited a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;The thing
is big&mdash;the biggest I&rsquo;ve ever done.&nbsp; I know that.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s my swan song.&nbsp; I am almighty proud of it.&nbsp; I worship
it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s better than whiskey.&nbsp; It is what I dreamed
of&mdash;the great and perfect thing&mdash;when I was a simple young
man, with sweet illusions and clean ideals.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve got
it, now, in my last grasp, and I&rsquo;ll not have it pawed over and
soiled by a lot of swine.&nbsp; No, I won&rsquo;t take the bet.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s mine.&nbsp; I made it, and I&rsquo;ve shared it with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of the rest of the world,&rdquo; Martin protested.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The function of beauty is joy-making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be selfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not selfish.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brissenden grinned soberly
in the way he had when pleased by the thing his thin lips were about
to shape.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as unselfish as a famished hog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In vain Martin strove to shake him from his decision.&nbsp; Martin
told him that his hatred of the magazines was rabid, fanatical, and
that his conduct was a thousand times more despicable than that of the
youth who burned the temple of Diana at Ephesus.&nbsp; Under the storm
of denunciation Brissenden complacently sipped his toddy and affirmed
that everything the other said was quite true, with the exception of
the magazine editors.&nbsp; His hatred of them knew no bounds, and he
excelled Martin in denunciation when he turned upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d type it for me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know how a thousand times better than any stenographer.&nbsp; And now
I want to give you some advice.&rdquo;&nbsp; He drew a bulky manuscript
from his outside coat pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your &lsquo;Shame
of the Sun.&rsquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve read it not once, but twice and
three times&mdash;the highest compliment I can pay you.&nbsp; After
what you&rsquo;ve said about &lsquo;Ephemera&rsquo; I must be silent.&nbsp;
But this I will say: when &lsquo;The Shame of the Sun&rsquo; is published,
it will make a hit.&nbsp; It will start a controversy that will be worth
thousands to you just in advertising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose your next advice will be to
submit it to the magazines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means no&mdash;that is, if you want to see it in print.&nbsp;
Offer it to the first-class houses.&nbsp; Some publisher&rsquo;s reader
may be mad enough or drunk enough to report favorably on it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
read the books.&nbsp; The meat of them has been transmuted in the alembic
of Martin Eden&rsquo;s mind and poured into &lsquo;The Shame of the
Sun,&rsquo; and one day Martin Eden will be famous, and not the least
of his fame will rest upon that work.&nbsp; So you must get a publisher
for it&mdash;the sooner the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brissenden went home late that night; and just as he mounted the
first step of the car, he swung suddenly back on Martin and thrust into
his hand a small, tightly crumpled wad of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, take this,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was out to
the races to-day, and I had the right dope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bell clanged and the car pulled out, leaving Martin wondering
as to the nature of the crinkly, greasy wad he clutched in his hand.&nbsp;
Back in his room he unrolled it and found a hundred-dollar bill.</p>
<p>He did not scruple to use it.&nbsp; He knew his friend had always
plenty of money, and he knew also, with profound certitude, that his
success would enable him to repay it.&nbsp; In the morning he paid every
bill, gave Maria three months&rsquo; advance on the room, and redeemed
every pledge at the pawnshop.&nbsp; Next he bought Marian&rsquo;s wedding
present, and simpler presents, suitable to Christmas, for Ruth and Gertrude.&nbsp;
And finally, on the balance remaining to him, he herded the whole Silva
tribe down into Oakland.&nbsp; He was a winter late in redeeming his
promise, but redeemed it was, for the last, least Silva got a pair of
shoes, as well as Maria herself.&nbsp; Also, there were horns, and dolls,
and toys of various sorts, and parcels and bundles of candies and nuts
that filled the arms of all the Silvas to overflowing.</p>
<p>It was with this extraordinary procession trooping at his and Maria&rsquo;s
heels into a confectioner&rsquo;s in quest if the biggest candy-cane
ever made, that he encountered Ruth and her mother.&nbsp; Mrs. Morse
was shocked.&nbsp; Even Ruth was hurt, for she had some regard for appearances,
and her lover, cheek by jowl with Maria, at the head of that army of
Portuguese ragamuffins, was not a pretty sight.&nbsp; But it was not
that which hurt so much as what she took to be his lack of pride and
self-respect.&nbsp; Further, and keenest of all, she read into the incident
the impossibility of his living down his working-class origin.&nbsp;
There was stigma enough in the fact of it, but shamelessly to flaunt
it in the face of the world&mdash;her world&mdash;was going too far.&nbsp;
Though her engagement to Martin had been kept secret, their long intimacy
had not been unproductive of gossip; and in the shop, glancing covertly
at her lover and his following, had been several of her acquaintances.&nbsp;
She lacked the easy largeness of Martin and could not rise superior
to her environment.&nbsp; She had been hurt to the quick, and her sensitive
nature was quivering with the shame of it.&nbsp; So it was, when Martin
arrived later in the day, that he kept her present in his breast-pocket,
deferring the giving of it to a more propitious occasion.&nbsp; Ruth
in tears&mdash;passionate, angry tears&mdash;was a revelation to him.&nbsp;
The spectacle of her suffering convinced him that he had been a brute,
yet in the soul of him he could not see how nor why.&nbsp; It never
entered his head to be ashamed of those he knew, and to take the Silvas
out to a Christmas treat could in no way, so it seemed to him, show
lack of consideration for Ruth.&nbsp; On the other hand, he did see
Ruth&rsquo;s point of view, after she had explained it; and he looked
upon it as a feminine weakness, such as afflicted all women and the
best of women.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show you the real dirt,&rdquo; Brissenden
said to him, one evening in January.</p>
<p>They had dined together in San Francisco, and were at the Ferry Building,
returning to Oakland, when the whim came to him to show Martin the &ldquo;real
dirt.&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned and fled across the water-front, a meagre
shadow in a flapping overcoat, with Martin straining to keep up with
him.&nbsp; At a wholesale liquor store he bought two gallon-demijohns
of old port, and with one in each hand boarded a Mission Street car,
Martin at his heels burdened with several quart-bottles of whiskey.</p>
<p>If Ruth could see me now, was his thought, while he wondered as to
what constituted the real dirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe nobody will be there,&rdquo; Brissenden said, when they
dismounted and plunged off to the right into the heart of the working-class
ghetto, south of Market Street.&nbsp; &ldquo;In which case you&rsquo;ll
miss what you&rsquo;ve been looking for so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what the deuce is that?&rdquo; Martin asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men, intelligent men, and not the gibbering nonentities I
found you consorting with in that trader&rsquo;s den.&nbsp; You read
the books and you found yourself all alone.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m going
to show you to-night some other men who&rsquo;ve read the books, so
that you won&rsquo;t be lonely any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I bother my head about their everlasting discussions,&rdquo;
he said at the end of a block.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested
in book philosophy.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll find these fellows intelligences
and not bourgeois swine.&nbsp; But watch out, they&rsquo;ll talk an
arm off of you on any subject under the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope Norton&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; he panted a little later,
resisting Martin&rsquo;s effort to relieve him of the two demijohns.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Norton&rsquo;s an idealist&mdash;a Harvard man.&nbsp; Prodigious
memory.&nbsp; Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family
threw him off.&nbsp; Father&rsquo;s a railroad president and many times
millionnaire, but the son&rsquo;s starving in &rsquo;Frisco, editing
an anarchist sheet for twenty-five a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin was little acquainted in San Francisco, and not at all south
of Market; so he had no idea of where he was being led.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;tell me about them beforehand.&nbsp;
What do they do for a living?&nbsp; How do they happen to be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope Hamilton&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brissenden paused
and rested his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Strawn-Hamilton&rsquo;s his name&mdash;hyphenated,
you know&mdash;comes of old Southern stock.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a tramp&mdash;laziest
man I ever knew, though he&rsquo;s clerking, or trying to, in a socialist
co&ouml;perative store for six dollars a week.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s
a confirmed hobo.&nbsp; Tramped into town.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen him
sit all day on a bench and never a bite pass his lips, and in the evening,
when I invited him to dinner&mdash;restaurant two blocks away&mdash;have
him say, &lsquo;Too much trouble, old man.&nbsp; Buy me a package of
cigarettes instead.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was a Spencerian like you till Kreis
turned him to materialistic monism.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll start him on monism
if I can.&nbsp; Norton&rsquo;s another monist&mdash;only he affirms
naught but spirit.&nbsp; He can give Kreis and Hamilton all they want,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Kreis?&rdquo; Martin asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His rooms we&rsquo;re going to.&nbsp; One time professor&mdash;fired
from university&mdash;usual story.&nbsp; A mind like a steel trap.&nbsp;
Makes his living any old way.&nbsp; I know he&rsquo;s been a street
fakir when he was down.&nbsp; Unscrupulous.&nbsp; Rob a corpse of a
shroud&mdash;anything.&nbsp; Difference between him&mdash;and the bourgeoisie
is that he robs without illusion.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll talk Nietzsche,
or Schopenhauer, or Kant, or anything, but the only thing in this world,
not excepting Mary, that he really cares for, is his monism.&nbsp; Haeckel
is his little tin god.&nbsp; The only way to insult him is to take a
slap at Haeckel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the hang-out.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brissenden rested
his demijohn at the upstairs entrance, preliminary to the climb.&nbsp;
It was the usual two-story corner building, with a saloon and grocery
underneath.&nbsp; &ldquo;The gang lives here&mdash;got the whole upstairs
to themselves.&nbsp; But Kreis is the only one who has two rooms.&nbsp;
Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No lights burned in the upper hall, but Brissenden threaded the utter
blackness like a familiar ghost.&nbsp; He stopped to speak to Martin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one fellow&mdash;Stevens&mdash;a theosophist.&nbsp;
Makes a pretty tangle when he gets going.&nbsp; Just now he&rsquo;s
dish-washer in a restaurant.&nbsp; Likes a good cigar.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
seen him eat in a ten-cent hash-house and pay fifty cents for the cigar
he smoked afterward.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got a couple in my pocket for
him, if he shows up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another fellow&mdash;Parry&mdash;an Australian,
a statistician and a sporting encyclopaedia.&nbsp; Ask him the grain
output of Paraguay for 1903, or the English importation of sheetings
into China for 1890, or at what weight Jimmy Britt fought Battling Nelson,
or who was welter-weight champion of the United States in &rsquo;68,
and you&rsquo;ll get the correct answer with the automatic celerity
of a slot-machine.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s Andy, a stone-mason, has
ideas on everything, a good chess-player; and another fellow, Harry,
a baker, red hot socialist and strong union man.&nbsp; By the way, you
remember Cooks&rsquo; and Waiters&rsquo; strike&mdash;Hamilton was the
chap who organized that union and precipitated the strike&mdash;planned
it all out in advance, right here in Kreis&rsquo;s rooms.&nbsp; Did
it just for the fun of it, but was too lazy to stay by the union.&nbsp;
Yet he could have risen high if he wanted to.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
end to the possibilities in that man&mdash;if he weren&rsquo;t so insuperably
lazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brissenden advanced through the darkness till a thread of light marked
the threshold of a door.&nbsp; A knock and an answer opened it, and
Martin found himself shaking hands with Kreis, a handsome brunette man,
with dazzling white teeth, a drooping black mustache, and large, flashing
black eyes.&nbsp; Mary, a matronly young blonde, was washing dishes
in the little back room that served for kitchen and dining room.&nbsp;
The front room served as bedchamber and living room.&nbsp; Overhead
was the week&rsquo;s washing, hanging in festoons so low that Martin
did not see at first the two men talking in a corner.&nbsp; They hailed
Brissenden and his demijohns with acclamation, and, on being introduced,
Martin learned they were Andy and Parry.&nbsp; He joined them and listened
attentively to the description of a prize-fight Parry had seen the night
before; while Brissenden, in his glory, plunged into the manufacture
of a toddy and the serving of wine and whiskey-and-sodas.&nbsp; At his
command, &ldquo;Bring in the clan,&rdquo; Andy departed to go the round
of the rooms for the lodgers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lucky that most of them are here,&rdquo; Brissenden
whispered to Martin.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Norton and Hamilton;
come on and meet them.&nbsp; Stevens isn&rsquo;t around, I hear.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m going to get them started on monism if I can.&nbsp; Wait till
they get a few jolts in them and they&rsquo;ll warm up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first the conversation was desultory.&nbsp; Nevertheless Martin
could not fail to appreciate the keen play of their minds.&nbsp; They
were men with opinions, though the opinions often clashed, and, though
they were witty and clever, they were not superficial.&nbsp; He swiftly
saw, no matter upon what they talked, that each man applied the correlation
of knowledge and had also a deep-seated and unified conception of society
and the Cosmos.&nbsp; Nobody manufactured their opinions for them; they
were all rebels of one variety or another, and their lips were strangers
to platitudes.&nbsp; Never had Martin, at the Morses&rsquo;, heard so
amazing a range of topics discussed.&nbsp; There seemed no limit save
time to the things they were alive to.&nbsp; The talk wandered from
Mrs. Humphry Ward&rsquo;s new book to Shaw&rsquo;s latest play, through
the future of the drama to reminiscences of Mansfield.&nbsp; They appreciated
or sneered at the morning editorials, jumped from labor conditions in
New Zealand to Henry James and Brander Matthews, passed on to the German
designs in the Far East and the economic aspect of the Yellow Peril,
wrangled over the German elections and Bebel&rsquo;s last speech, and
settled down to local politics, the latest plans and scandals in the
union labor party administration, and the wires that were pulled to
bring about the Coast Seamen&rsquo;s strike.&nbsp; Martin was struck
by the inside knowledge they possessed.&nbsp; They knew what was never
printed in the newspapers&mdash;the wires and strings and the hidden
hands that made the puppets dance.&nbsp; To Martin&rsquo;s surprise,
the girl, Mary, joined in the conversation, displaying an intelligence
he had never encountered in the few women he had met.&nbsp; They talked
together on Swinburne and Rossetti, after which she led him beyond his
depth into the by-paths of French literature.&nbsp; His revenge came
when she defended Maeterlinck and he brought into action the carefully-thought-out
thesis of &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several other men had dropped in, and the air was thick with tobacco
smoke, when Brissenden waved the red flag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s fresh meat for your axe, Kreis,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;a rose-white youth with the ardor of a lover for Herbert Spencer.&nbsp;
Make a Haeckelite of him&mdash;if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kreis seemed to wake up and flash like some metallic, magnetic thing,
while Norton looked at Martin sympathetically, with a sweet, girlish
smile, as much as to say that he would be amply protected.</p>
<p>Kreis began directly on Martin, but step by step Norton interfered,
until he and Kreis were off and away in a personal battle.&nbsp; Martin
listened and fain would have rubbed his eyes.&nbsp; It was impossible
that this should be, much less in the labor ghetto south of Market.&nbsp;
The books were alive in these men.&nbsp; They talked with fire and enthusiasm,
the intellectual stimulant stirring them as he had seen drink and anger
stir other men.&nbsp; What he heard was no longer the philosophy of
the dry, printed word, written by half-mythical demigods like Kant and
Spencer.&nbsp; It was living philosophy, with warm, red blood, incarnated
in these two men till its very features worked with excitement.&nbsp;
Now and again other men joined in, and all followed the discussion with
cigarettes going out in their hands and with alert, intent faces.</p>
<p>Idealism had never attracted Martin, but the exposition it now received
at the hands of Norton was a revelation.&nbsp; The logical plausibility
of it, that made an appeal to his intellect, seemed missed by Kreis
and Hamilton, who sneered at Norton as a metaphysician, and who, in
turn, sneered back at them as metaphysicians.&nbsp; <i>Phenomenon</i>
and <i>noumenon</i> were bandied back and forth.&nbsp; They charged
him with attempting to explain consciousness by itself.&nbsp; He charged
them with word-jugglery, with reasoning from words to theory instead
of from facts to theory.&nbsp; At this they were aghast.&nbsp; It was
the cardinal tenet of their mode of reasoning to start with facts and
to give names to the facts.</p>
<p>When Norton wandered into the intricacies of Kant, Kreis reminded
him that all good little German philosophies when they died went to
Oxford.&nbsp; A little later Norton reminded them of Hamilton&rsquo;s
Law of Parsimony, the application of which they immediately claimed
for every reasoning process of theirs.&nbsp; And Martin hugged his knees
and exulted in it all.&nbsp; But Norton was no Spencerian, and he, too,
strove for Martin&rsquo;s philosophic soul, talking as much at him as
to his two opponents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Berkeley has never been answered,&rdquo; he said,
looking directly at Martin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Herbert Spencer came the nearest,
which was not very near.&nbsp; Even the stanchest of Spencer&rsquo;s
followers will not go farther.&nbsp; I was reading an essay of Saleeby&rsquo;s
the other day, and the best Saleeby could say was that Herbert Spencer
<i>nearly</i> succeeded in answering Berkeley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what Hume said?&rdquo; Hamilton asked.&nbsp; Norton
nodded, but Hamilton gave it for the benefit of the rest.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
said that Berkeley&rsquo;s arguments admit of no answer and produce
no conviction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his, Hume&rsquo;s, mind,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
Hume&rsquo;s mind was the same as yours, with this difference: he was
wise enough to admit there was no answering Berkeley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norton was sensitive and excitable, though he never lost his head,
while Kreis and Hamilton were like a pair of cold-blooded savages, seeking
out tender places to prod and poke.&nbsp; As the evening grew late,
Norton, smarting under the repeated charges of being a metaphysician,
clutching his chair to keep from jumping to his feet, his gray eyes
snapping and his girlish face grown harsh and sure, made a grand attack
upon their position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, you Haeckelites, I may reason like a medicine man,
but, pray, how do you reason?&nbsp; You have nothing to stand on, you
unscientific dogmatists with your positive science which you are always
lugging about into places it has no right to be.&nbsp; Long before the
school of materialistic monism arose, the ground was removed so that
there could be no foundation.&nbsp; Locke was the man, John Locke.&nbsp;
Two hundred years ago&mdash;more than that, even in his &lsquo;Essay
concerning the Human Understanding,&rsquo; he proved the non-existence
of innate ideas.&nbsp; The best of it is that that is precisely what
you claim.&nbsp; To-night, again and again, you have asserted the non-existence
of innate ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does that mean?&nbsp; It means that you can never
know ultimate reality.&nbsp; Your brains are empty when you are born.&nbsp;
Appearances, or phenomena, are all the content your minds can receive
from your five senses.&nbsp; Then noumena, which are not in your minds
when you are born, have no way of getting in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deny&mdash;&rdquo; Kreis started to interrupt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait till I&rsquo;m done,&rdquo; Norton shouted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You can know only that much of the play and interplay of force
and matter as impinges in one way or another on our senses.&nbsp; You
see, I am willing to admit, for the sake of the argument, that matter
exists; and what I am about to do is to efface you by your own argument.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t do it any other way, for you are both congenitally unable
to understand a philosophic abstraction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, what do you know of matter, according to your own
positive science?&nbsp; You know it only by its phenomena, its appearances.&nbsp;
You are aware only of its changes, or of such changes in it as cause
changes in your consciousness.&nbsp; Positive science deals only with
phenomena, yet you are foolish enough to strive to be ontologists and
to deal with noumena.&nbsp; Yet, by the very definition of positive
science, science is concerned only with appearances.&nbsp; As somebody
has said, phenomenal knowledge cannot transcend phenomena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot answer Berkeley, even if you have annihilated Kant,
and yet, perforce, you assume that Berkeley is wrong when you affirm
that science proves the non-existence of God, or, as much to the point,
the existence of matter.&mdash;You know I granted the reality of matter
only in order to make myself intelligible to your understanding.&nbsp;
Be positive scientists, if you please; but ontology has no place in
positive science, so leave it alone.&nbsp; Spencer is right in his agnosticism,
but if Spencer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was time to catch the last ferry-boat for Oakland, and Brissenden
and Martin slipped out, leaving Norton still talking and Kreis and Hamilton
waiting to pounce on him like a pair of hounds as soon as he finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have given me a glimpse of fairyland,&rdquo; Martin said
on the ferry-boat.&nbsp; &ldquo;It makes life worth while to meet people
like that.&nbsp; My mind is all worked up.&nbsp; I never appreciated
idealism before.&nbsp; Yet I can&rsquo;t accept it.&nbsp; I know that
I shall always be a realist.&nbsp; I am so made, I guess.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;d like to have made a reply to Kreis and Hamilton, and I think
I&rsquo;d have had a word or two for Norton.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t see
that Spencer was damaged any.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as excited as a child
on its first visit to the circus.&nbsp; I see I must read up some more.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m going to get hold of Saleeby.&nbsp; I still think Spencer
is unassailable, and next time I&rsquo;m going to take a hand myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Brissenden, breathing painfully, had dropped off to sleep, his
chin buried in a scarf and resting on his sunken chest, his body wrapped
in the long overcoat and shaking to the vibration of the propellers.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<p>The first thing Martin did next morning was to go counter both to
Brissenden&rsquo;s advice and command.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Shame of the
Sun&rdquo; he wrapped and mailed to <i>The Acropolis</i>.&nbsp; He believed
he could find magazine publication for it, and he felt that recognition
by the magazines would commend him to the book-publishing houses.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; he likewise wrapped and mailed to a magazine.&nbsp;
Despite Brissenden&rsquo;s prejudice against the magazines, which was
a pronounced mania with him, Martin decided that the great poem should
see print.&nbsp; He did not intend, however, to publish it without the
other&rsquo;s permission.&nbsp; His plan was to get it accepted by one
of the high magazines, and, thus armed, again to wrestle with Brissenden
for consent.</p>
<p>Martin began, that morning, a story which he had sketched out a number
of weeks before and which ever since had been worrying him with its
insistent clamor to be created.&nbsp; Apparently it was to be a rattling
sea story, a tale of twentieth-century adventure and romance, handling
real characters, in a real world, under real conditions.&nbsp; But beneath
the swing and go of the story was to be something else&mdash;something
that the superficial reader would never discern and which, on the other
hand, would not diminish in any way the interest and enjoyment for such
a reader.&nbsp; It was this, and not the mere story, that impelled Martin
to write it.&nbsp; For that matter, it was always the great, universal
motif that suggested plots to him.&nbsp; After having found such a motif,
he cast about for the particular persons and particular location in
time and space wherewith and wherein to utter the universal thing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Overdue&rdquo; was the title he had decided for it, and its length
he believed would not be more than sixty thousand words&mdash;a bagatelle
for him with his splendid vigor of production.&nbsp; On this first day
he took hold of it with conscious delight in the mastery of his tools.&nbsp;
He no longer worried for fear that the sharp, cutting edges should slip
and mar his work.&nbsp; The long months of intense application and study
had brought their reward.&nbsp; He could now devote himself with sure
hand to the larger phases of the thing he shaped; and as he worked,
hour after hour, he felt, as never before, the sure and cosmic grasp
with which he held life and the affairs of life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Overdue&rdquo;
would tell a story that would be true of its particular characters and
its particular events; but it would tell, too, he was confident, great
vital things that would be true of all time, and all sea, and all life&mdash;thanks
to Herbert Spencer, he thought, leaning back for a moment from the table.&nbsp;
Ay, thanks to Herbert Spencer and to the master-key of life, evolution,
which Spencer had placed in his hands.</p>
<p>He was conscious that it was great stuff he was writing.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
will go!&nbsp; It will go!&rdquo; was the refrain that kept, sounding
in his ears.&nbsp; Of course it would go.&nbsp; At last he was turning
out the thing at which the magazines would jump.&nbsp; The whole story
worked out before him in lightning flashes.&nbsp; He broke off from
it long enough to write a paragraph in his note-book.&nbsp; This would
be the last paragraph in &ldquo;Overdue&rdquo;; but so thoroughly was
the whole book already composed in his brain that he could write, weeks
before he had arrived at the end, the end itself.&nbsp; He compared
the tale, as yet unwritten, with the tales of the sea-writers, and he
felt it to be immeasurably superior.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only
one man who could touch it,&rdquo; he murmured aloud, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s
Conrad.&nbsp; And it ought to make even him sit up and shake hands with
me, and say, &lsquo;Well done, Martin, my boy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He toiled on all day, recollecting, at the last moment, that he was
to have dinner at the Morses&rsquo;.&nbsp; Thanks to Brissenden, his
black suit was out of pawn and he was again eligible for dinner parties.&nbsp;
Down town he stopped off long enough to run into the library and search
for Saleeby&rsquo;s books.&nbsp; He drew out &ldquo;The Cycle of Life,&rdquo;
and on the car turned to the essay Norton had mentioned on Spencer.&nbsp;
As Martin read, he grew angry.&nbsp; His face flushed, his jaw set,
and unconsciously his hand clenched, unclenched, and clenched again
as if he were taking fresh grips upon some hateful thing out of which
he was squeezing the life.&nbsp; When he left the car, he strode along
the sidewalk as a wrathful man will stride, and he rang the Morse bell
with such viciousness that it roused him to consciousness of his condition,
so that he entered in good nature, smiling with amusement at himself.&nbsp;
No sooner, however, was he inside than a great depression descended
upon him.&nbsp; He fell from the height where he had been up-borne all
day on the wings of inspiration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bourgeois,&rdquo; &ldquo;trader&rsquo;s
den&rdquo;&mdash;Brissenden&rsquo;s epithets repeated themselves in
his mind.&nbsp; But what of that? he demanded angrily.&nbsp; He was
marrying Ruth, not her family.</p>
<p>It seemed to him that he had never seen Ruth more beautiful, more
spiritual and ethereal and at the same time more healthy.&nbsp; There
was color in her cheeks, and her eyes drew him again and again&mdash;the
eyes in which he had first read immortality.&nbsp; He had forgotten
immortality of late, and the trend of his scientific reading had been
away from it; but here, in Ruth&rsquo;s eyes, he read an argument without
words that transcended all worded arguments.&nbsp; He saw that in her
eyes before which all discussion fled away, for he saw love there.&nbsp;
And in his own eyes was love; and love was unanswerable.&nbsp; Such
was his passionate doctrine.</p>
<p>The half hour he had with her, before they went in to dinner, left
him supremely happy and supremely satisfied with life.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
at table, the inevitable reaction and exhaustion consequent upon the
hard day seized hold of him.&nbsp; He was aware that his eyes were tired
and that he was irritable.&nbsp; He remembered it was at this table,
at which he now sneered and was so often bored, that he had first eaten
with civilized beings in what he had imagined was an atmosphere of high
culture and refinement.&nbsp; He caught a glimpse of that pathetic figure
of him, so long ago, a self-conscious savage, sprouting sweat at every
pore in an agony of apprehension, puzzled by the bewildering minutiae
of eating-implements, tortured by the ogre of a servant, striving at
a leap to live at such dizzy social altitude, and deciding in the end
to be frankly himself, pretending no knowledge and no polish he did
not possess.</p>
<p>He glanced at Ruth for reassurance, much in the same manner that
a passenger, with sudden panic thought of possible shipwreck, will strive
to locate the life preservers.&nbsp; Well, that much had come out of
it&mdash;love and Ruth.&nbsp; All the rest had failed to stand the test
of the books.&nbsp; But Ruth and love had stood the test; for them he
found a biological sanction.&nbsp; Love was the most exalted expression
of life.&nbsp; Nature had been busy designing him, as she had been busy
with all normal men, for the purpose of loving.&nbsp; She had spent
ten thousand centuries&mdash;ay, a hundred thousand and a million centuries&mdash;upon
the task, and he was the best she could do.&nbsp; She had made love
the strongest thing in him, increased its power a myriad per cent with
her gift of imagination, and sent him forth into the ephemera to thrill
and melt and mate.&nbsp; His hand sought Ruth&rsquo;s hand beside him
hidden by the table, and a warm pressure was given and received.&nbsp;
She looked at him a swift instant, and her eyes were radiant and melting.&nbsp;
So were his in the thrill that pervaded him; nor did he realize how
much that was radiant and melting in her eyes had been aroused by what
she had seen in his.</p>
<p>Across the table from him, cater-cornered, at Mr. Morse&rsquo;s right,
sat Judge Blount, a local superior court judge.&nbsp; Martin had met
him a number of times and had failed to like him.&nbsp; He and Ruth&rsquo;s
father were discussing labor union politics, the local situation, and
socialism, and Mr. Morse was endeavoring to twit Martin on the latter
topic.&nbsp; At last Judge Blount looked across the table with benignant
and fatherly pity.&nbsp; Martin smiled to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll grow out of it, young man,&rdquo; he said soothingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Time is the best cure for such youthful distempers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He turned to Mr. Morse.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not believe discussion is
good in such cases.&nbsp; It makes the patient obstinate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; the other assented gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
it is well to warn the patient occasionally of his condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin laughed merrily, but it was with an effort.&nbsp; The day
had been too long, the day&rsquo;s effort too intense, and he was deep
in the throes of the reaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly you are both excellent doctors,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;but if you care a whit for the opinion of the patient, let him
tell you that you are poor diagnosticians.&nbsp; In fact, you are both
suffering from the disease you think you find in me.&nbsp; As for me,
I am immune.&nbsp; The socialist philosophy that riots half-baked in
your veins has passed me by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clever, clever,&rdquo; murmured the judge.&nbsp; &ldquo;An
excellent ruse in controversy, to reverse positions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of your mouth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Martin&rsquo;s eyes were sparkling,
but he kept control of himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, Judge, I&rsquo;ve
heard your campaign speeches.&nbsp; By some henidical process&mdash;henidical,
by the way is a favorite word of mine which nobody understands&mdash;by
some henidical process you persuade yourself that you believe in the
competitive system and the survival of the strong, and at the same time
you indorse with might and main all sorts of measures to shear the strength
from the strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My young man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, I&rsquo;ve heard your campaign speeches,&rdquo;
Martin warned.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on record, your position on interstate
commerce regulation, on regulation of the railway trust and Standard
Oil, on the conservation of the forests, on a thousand and one restrictive
measures that are nothing else than socialistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that you do not believe in regulating
these various outrageous exercises of power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point.&nbsp; I mean to tell you that
you are a poor diagnostician.&nbsp; I mean to tell you that I am not
suffering from the microbe of socialism.&nbsp; I mean to tell you that
it is you who are suffering from the emasculating ravages of that same
microbe.&nbsp; As for me, I am an inveterate opponent of socialism just
as I am an inveterate opponent of your own mongrel democracy that is
nothing else than pseudo-socialism masquerading under a garb of words
that will not stand the test of the dictionary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a reactionary&mdash;so complete a reactionary that my
position is incomprehensible to you who live in a veiled lie of social
organization and whose sight is not keen enough to pierce the veil.&nbsp;
You make believe that you believe in the survival of the strong and
the rule of the strong.&nbsp; I believe.&nbsp; That is the difference.&nbsp;
When I was a trifle younger,&mdash;a few months younger,&mdash;I believed
the same thing.&nbsp; You see, the ideas of you and yours had impressed
me.&nbsp; But merchants and traders are cowardly rulers at best; they
grunt and grub all their days in the trough of money-getting, and I
have swung back to aristocracy, if you please.&nbsp; I am the only individualist
in this room.&nbsp; I look to the state for nothing.&nbsp; I look only
to the strong man, the man on horseback, to save the state from its
own rotten futility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nietzsche was right.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t take the time to
tell you who Nietzsche was, but he was right.&nbsp; The world belongs
to the strong&mdash;to the strong who are noble as well and who do not
wallow in the swine-trough of trade and exchange.&nbsp; The world belongs
to the true nobleman, to the great blond beasts, to the noncompromisers,
to the &lsquo;yes-sayers.&rsquo;&nbsp; And they will eat you up, you
socialists&mdash;who are afraid of socialism and who think yourselves
individualists.&nbsp; Your slave-morality of the meek and lowly will
never save you.&mdash;Oh, it&rsquo;s all Greek, I know, and I won&rsquo;t
bother you any more with it.&nbsp; But remember one thing.&nbsp; There
aren&rsquo;t half a dozen individualists in Oakland, but Martin Eden
is one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He signified that he was done with the discussion, and turned to
Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wrought up to-day,&rdquo; he said in an undertone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All I want to do is to love, not talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ignored Mr. Morse, who said:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am unconvinced.&nbsp; All socialists are Jesuits.&nbsp;
That is the way to tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make a good Republican out of you yet,&rdquo;
said Judge Blount.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man on horseback will arrive before that time,&rdquo;
Martin retorted with good humor, and returned to Ruth.</p>
<p>But Mr. Morse was not content.&nbsp; He did not like the laziness
and the disinclination for sober, legitimate work of this prospective
son-in-law of his, for whose ideas he had no respect and of whose nature
he had no understanding.&nbsp; So he turned the conversation to Herbert
Spencer.&nbsp; Judge Blount ably seconded him, and Martin, whose ears
had pricked at the first mention of the philosopher&rsquo;s name, listened
to the judge enunciate a grave and complacent diatribe against Spencer.&nbsp;
From time to time Mr. Morse glanced at Martin, as much as to say, &ldquo;There,
my boy, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chattering daws,&rdquo; Martin muttered under his breath,
and went on talking with Ruth and Arthur.</p>
<p>But the long day and the &ldquo;real dirt&rdquo; of the night before
were telling upon him; and, besides, still in his burnt mind was what
had made him angry when he read it on the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; Ruth asked suddenly alarmed by
the effort he was making to contain himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no god but the Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is
its prophet,&rdquo; Judge Blount was saying at that moment.</p>
<p>Martin turned upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cheap judgment,&rdquo; he remarked quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
heard it first in the City Hall Park, on the lips of a workingman who
ought to have known better.&nbsp; I have heard it often since, and each
time the clap-trap of it nauseates me.&nbsp; You ought to be ashamed
of yourself.&nbsp; To hear that great and noble man&rsquo;s name upon
your lips is like finding a dew-drop in a cesspool.&nbsp; You are disgusting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was like a thunderbolt.&nbsp; Judge Blount glared at him with
apoplectic countenance, and silence reigned.&nbsp; Mr. Morse was secretly
pleased.&nbsp; He could see that his daughter was shocked.&nbsp; It
was what he wanted to do&mdash;to bring out the innate ruffianism of
this man he did not like.</p>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s hand sought Martin&rsquo;s beseechingly under the table,
but his blood was up.&nbsp; He was inflamed by the intellectual pretence
and fraud of those who sat in the high places.&nbsp; A Superior Court
Judge!&nbsp; It was only several years before that he had looked up
from the mire at such glorious entities and deemed them gods.</p>
<p>Judge Blount recovered himself and attempted to go on, addressing
himself to Martin with an assumption of politeness that the latter understood
was for the benefit of the ladies.&nbsp; Even this added to his anger.&nbsp;
Was there no honesty in the world?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t discuss Spencer with me,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You do not know any more about Spencer than do his own countrymen.&nbsp;
But it is no fault of yours, I grant.&nbsp; It is just a phase of the
contemptible ignorance of the times.&nbsp; I ran across a sample of
it on my way here this evening.&nbsp; I was reading an essay by Saleeby
on Spencer.&nbsp; You should read it.&nbsp; It is accessible to all
men.&nbsp; You can buy it in any book-store or draw it from the public
library.&nbsp; You would feel ashamed of your paucity of abuse and ignorance
of that noble man compared with what Saleeby has collected on the subject.&nbsp;
It is a record of shame that would shame your shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The philosopher of the half-educated,&rsquo; he was
called by an academic Philosopher who was not worthy to pollute the
atmosphere he breathed.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think you have read ten
pages of Spencer, but there have been critics, assumably more intelligent
than you, who have read no more than you of Spencer, who publicly challenged
his followers to adduce one single idea from all his writings&mdash;from
Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s writings, the man who has impressed the stamp
of his genius over the whole field of scientific research and modern
thought; the father of psychology; the man who revolutionized pedagogy,
so that to-day the child of the French peasant is taught the three R&rsquo;s
according to principles laid down by him.&nbsp; And the little gnats
of men sting his memory when they get their very bread and butter from
the technical application of his ideas.&nbsp; What little of worth resides
in their brains is largely due to him.&nbsp; It is certain that had
he never lived, most of what is correct in their parrot-learned knowledge
would be absent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet a man like Principal Fairbanks of Oxford&mdash;a man
who sits in an even higher place than you, Judge Blount&mdash;has said
that Spencer will be dismissed by posterity as a poet and dreamer rather
than a thinker.&nbsp; Yappers and blatherskites, the whole brood of
them!&nbsp; &lsquo;&ldquo;First Principles&rdquo; is not wholly destitute
of a certain literary power,&rsquo; said one of them.&nbsp; And others
of them have said that he was an industrious plodder rather than an
original thinker.&nbsp; Yappers and blatherskites!&nbsp; Yappers and
blatherskites!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin ceased abruptly, in a dead silence.&nbsp; Everybody in Ruth&rsquo;s
family looked up to Judge Blount as a man of power and achievement,
and they were horrified at Martin&rsquo;s outbreak.&nbsp; The remainder
of the dinner passed like a funeral, the judge and Mr. Morse confining
their talk to each other, and the rest of the conversation being extremely
desultory.&nbsp; Then afterward, when Ruth and Martin were alone, there
was a scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are unbearable,&rdquo; she wept.</p>
<p>But his anger still smouldered, and he kept muttering, &ldquo;The
beasts!&nbsp; The beasts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she averred he had insulted the judge, he retorted:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;By telling the truth about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether it was true or not,&rdquo; she
insisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are certain bounds of decency, and you
had no license to insult anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where did Judge Blount get the license to assault truth?&rdquo;
Martin demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely to assault truth is a more serious
misdemeanor than to insult a pygmy personality such as the judge&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
He did worse than that.&nbsp; He blackened the name of a great, noble
man who is dead.&nbsp; Oh, the beasts!&nbsp; The beasts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His complex anger flamed afresh, and Ruth was in terror of him.&nbsp;
Never had she seen him so angry, and it was all mystified and unreasonable
to her comprehension.&nbsp; And yet, through her very terror ran the
fibres of fascination that had drawn and that still drew her to him&mdash;that
had compelled her to lean towards him, and, in that mad, culminating
moment, lay her hands upon his neck.&nbsp; She was hurt and outraged
by what had taken place, and yet she lay in his arms and quivered while
he went on muttering, &ldquo;The beasts!&nbsp; The beasts!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And she still lay there when he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not bother your
table again, dear.&nbsp; They do not like me, and it is wrong of me
to thrust my objectionable presence upon them.&nbsp; Besides, they are
just as objectionable to me.&nbsp; Faugh!&nbsp; They are sickening.&nbsp;
And to think of it, I dreamed in my innocence that the persons who sat
in the high places, who lived in fine houses and had educations and
bank accounts, were worth while!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go down to the local.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spoke Brissenden, faint from a hemorrhage of half an hour before&mdash;the
second hemorrhage in three days.&nbsp; The perennial whiskey glass was
in his hands, and he drained it with shaking fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I want with socialism?&rdquo; Martin demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outsiders are allowed five-minute speeches,&rdquo; the sick
man urged.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get up and spout.&nbsp; Tell them why you don&rsquo;t
want socialism.&nbsp; Tell them what you think about them and their
ghetto ethics.&nbsp; Slam Nietzsche into them and get walloped for your
pains.&nbsp; Make a scrap of it.&nbsp; It will do them good.&nbsp; Discussion
is what they want, and what you want, too.&nbsp; You see, I&rsquo;d
like to see you a socialist before I&rsquo;m gone.&nbsp; It will give
you a sanction for your existence.&nbsp; It is the one thing that will
save you in the time of disappointment that is coming to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never can puzzle out why you, of all men, are a socialist,&rdquo;
Martin pondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You detest the crowd so.&nbsp; Surely
there is nothing in the canaille to recommend it to your aesthetic soul.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He pointed an accusing finger at the whiskey glass which the other was
refilling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Socialism doesn&rsquo;t seem to save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sick,&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;With
you it is different.&nbsp; You have health and much to live for, and
you must be handcuffed to life somehow.&nbsp; As for me, you wonder
why I am a socialist.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you.&nbsp; It is because
Socialism is inevitable; because the present rotten and irrational system
cannot endure; because the day is past for your man on horseback.&nbsp;
The slaves won&rsquo;t stand for it.&nbsp; They are too many, and willy-nilly
they&rsquo;ll drag down the would-be equestrian before ever he gets
astride.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t get away from them, and you&rsquo;ll
have to swallow the whole slave-morality.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not a nice
mess, I&rsquo;ll allow.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s been a-brewing and swallow
it you must.&nbsp; You are antediluvian anyway, with your Nietzsche
ideas.&nbsp; The past is past, and the man who says history repeats
itself is a liar.&nbsp; Of course I don&rsquo;t like the crowd, but
what&rsquo;s a poor chap to do?&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t have the man on
horseback, and anything is preferable to the timid swine that now rule.&nbsp;
But come on, anyway.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m loaded to the guards now, and if
I sit here any longer, I&rsquo;ll get drunk.&nbsp; And you know the
doctor says&mdash;damn the doctor!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll fool him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Sunday night, and they found the small hall packed by the
Oakland socialists, chiefly members of the working class.&nbsp; The
speaker, a clever Jew, won Martin&rsquo;s admiration at the same time
that he aroused his antagonism.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s stooped and narrow
shoulders and weazened chest proclaimed him the true child of the crowded
ghetto, and strong on Martin was the age-long struggle of the feeble,
wretched slaves against the lordly handful of men who had ruled over
them and would rule over them to the end of time.&nbsp; To Martin this
withered wisp of a creature was a symbol.&nbsp; He was the figure that
stood forth representative of the whole miserable mass of weaklings
and inefficients who perished according to biological law on the ragged
confines of life.&nbsp; They were the unfit.&nbsp; In spite of their
cunning philosophy and of their antlike proclivities for co&ouml;peration,
Nature rejected them for the exceptional man.&nbsp; Out of the plentiful
spawn of life she flung from her prolific hand she selected only the
best.&nbsp; It was by the same method that men, aping her, bred race-horses
and cucumbers.&nbsp; Doubtless, a creator of a Cosmos could have devised
a better method; but creatures of this particular Cosmos must put up
with this particular method.&nbsp; Of course, they could squirm as they
perished, as the socialists squirmed, as the speaker on the platform
and the perspiring crowd were squirming even now as they counselled
together for some new device with which to minimize the penalties of
living and outwit the Cosmos.</p>
<p>So Martin thought, and so he spoke when Brissenden urged him to give
them hell.&nbsp; He obeyed the mandate, walking up to the platform,
as was the custom, and addressing the chairman.&nbsp; He began in a
low voice, haltingly, forming into order the ideas which had surged
in his brain while the Jew was speaking.&nbsp; In such meetings five
minutes was the time allotted to each speaker; but when Martin&rsquo;s
five minutes were up, he was in full stride, his attack upon their doctrines
but half completed.&nbsp; He had caught their interest, and the audience
urged the chairman by acclamation to extend Martin&rsquo;s time.&nbsp;
They appreciated him as a foeman worthy of their intellect, and they
listened intently, following every word.&nbsp; He spoke with fire and
conviction, mincing no words in his attack upon the slaves and their
morality and tactics and frankly alluding to his hearers as the slaves
in question.&nbsp; He quoted Spencer and Malthus, and enunciated the
biological law of development.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he concluded, in a swift r&eacute;sum&eacute;,
&ldquo;no state composed of the slave-types can endure.&nbsp; The old
law of development still holds.&nbsp; In the struggle for existence,
as I have shown, the strong and the progeny of the strong tend to survive,
while the weak and the progeny of the weak are crushed and tend to perish.&nbsp;
The result is that the strong and the progeny of the strong survive,
and, so long as the struggle obtains, the strength of each generation
increases.&nbsp; That is development.&nbsp; But you slaves&mdash;it
is too bad to be slaves, I grant&mdash;but you slaves dream of a society
where the law of development will be annulled, where no weaklings and
inefficients will perish, where every inefficient will have as much
as he wants to eat as many times a day as he desires, and where all
will marry and have progeny&mdash;the weak as well as the strong.&nbsp;
What will be the result?&nbsp; No longer will the strength and life-value
of each generation increase.&nbsp; On the contrary, it will diminish.&nbsp;
There is the Nemesis of your slave philosophy.&nbsp; Your society of
slaves&mdash;of, by, and for, slaves&mdash;must inevitably weaken and
go to pieces as the life which composes it weakens and goes to pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, I am enunciating biology and not sentimental ethics.&nbsp;
No state of slaves can stand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the United States?&rdquo; a man yelled from the
audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how about it?&rdquo; Martin retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
thirteen colonies threw off their rulers and formed the Republic so-called.&nbsp;
The slaves were their own masters.&nbsp; There were no more masters
of the sword.&nbsp; But you couldn&rsquo;t get along without masters
of some sort, and there arose a new set of masters&mdash;not the great,
virile, noble men, but the shrewd and spidery traders and money-lenders.&nbsp;
And they enslaved you over again&mdash;but not frankly, as the true,
noble men would do with weight of their own right arms, but secretly,
by spidery machinations and by wheedling and cajolery and lies.&nbsp;
They have purchased your slave judges, they have debauched your slave
legislatures, and they have forced to worse horrors than chattel slavery
your slave boys and girls.&nbsp; Two million of your children are toiling
to-day in this trader-oligarchy of the United States.&nbsp; Ten millions
of you slaves are not properly sheltered nor properly fed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to return.&nbsp; I have shown that no society of slaves
can endure, because, in its very nature, such society must annul the
law of development.&nbsp; No sooner can a slave society be organized
than deterioration sets in.&nbsp; It is easy for you to talk of annulling
the law of development, but where is the new law of development that
will maintain your strength?&nbsp; Formulate it.&nbsp; Is it already
formulated?&nbsp; Then state it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin took his seat amidst an uproar of voices.&nbsp; A score of
men were on their feet clamoring for recognition from the chair.&nbsp;
And one by one, encouraged by vociferous applause, speaking with fire
and enthusiasm and excited gestures, they replied to the attack.&nbsp;
It was a wild night&mdash;but it was wild intellectually, a battle of
ideas.&nbsp; Some strayed from the point, but most of the speakers replied
directly to Martin.&nbsp; They shook him with lines of thought that
were new to him; and gave him insights, not into new biological laws,
but into new applications of the old laws.&nbsp; They were too earnest
to be always polite, and more than once the chairman rapped and pounded
for order.</p>
<p>It chanced that a cub reporter sat in the audience, detailed there
on a day dull of news and impressed by the urgent need of journalism
for sensation.&nbsp; He was not a bright cub reporter.&nbsp; He was
merely facile and glib.&nbsp; He was too dense to follow the discussion.&nbsp;
In fact, he had a comfortable feeling that he was vastly superior to
these wordy maniacs of the working class.&nbsp; Also, he had a great
respect for those who sat in the high places and dictated the policies
of nations and newspapers.&nbsp; Further, he had an ideal, namely, of
achieving that excellence of the perfect reporter who is able to make
something&mdash;even a great deal&mdash;out of nothing.</p>
<p>He did not know what all the talk was about.&nbsp; It was not necessary.&nbsp;
Words like <i>revolution</i> gave him his cue.&nbsp; Like a paleontologist,
able to reconstruct an entire skeleton from one fossil bone, he was
able to reconstruct a whole speech from the one word <i>revolution</i>.&nbsp;
He did it that night, and he did it well; and since Martin had made
the biggest stir, he put it all into his mouth and made him the arch-anarch
of the show, transforming his reactionary individualism into the most
lurid, red-shirt socialist utterance.&nbsp; The cub reporter was an
artist, and it was a large brush with which he laid on the local color&mdash;wild-eyed
long-haired men, neurasthenic and degenerate types of men, voices shaken
with passion, clenched fists raised on high, and all projected against
a background of oaths, yells, and the throaty rumbling of angry men.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>
<p>Over the coffee, in his little room, Martin read next morning&rsquo;s
paper.&nbsp; It was a novel experience to find himself head-lined, on
the first page at that; and he was surprised to learn that he was the
most notorious leader of the Oakland socialists.&nbsp; He ran over the
violent speech the cub reporter had constructed for him, and, though
at first he was angered by the fabrication, in the end he tossed the
paper aside with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either the man was drunk or criminally malicious,&rdquo; he
said that afternoon, from his perch on the bed, when Brissenden had
arrived and dropped limply into the one chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you care?&rdquo; Brissenden asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely
you don&rsquo;t desire the approval of the bourgeois swine that read
the newspapers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin thought for a while, then said:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I really don&rsquo;t care for their approval, not a whit.&nbsp;
On the other hand, it&rsquo;s very likely to make my relations with
Ruth&rsquo;s family a trifle awkward.&nbsp; Her father always contended
I was a socialist, and this miserable stuff will clinch his belief.&nbsp;
Not that I care for his opinion&mdash;but what&rsquo;s the odds?&nbsp;
I want to read you what I&rsquo;ve been doing to-day.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Overdue,&rsquo; of course, and I&rsquo;m just about halfway through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was reading aloud when Maria thrust open the door and ushered
in a young man in a natty suit who glanced briskly about him, noting
the oil-burner and the kitchen in the corner before his gaze wandered
on to Martin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; Brissenden said.</p>
<p>Martin made room for the young man on the bed and waited for him
to broach his business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you speak last night, Mr. Eden, and I&rsquo;ve come
to interview you,&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>Brissenden burst out in a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A brother socialist?&rdquo; the reporter asked, with a quick
glance at Brissenden that appraised the color-value of that cadaverous
and dying man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he wrote that report,&rdquo; Martin said softly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, he is only a boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you poke him?&rdquo; Brissenden asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a thousand dollars to have my lungs back for five
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cub reporter was a trifle perplexed by this talking over him
and around him and at him.&nbsp; But he had been commended for his brilliant
description of the socialist meeting and had further been detailed to
get a personal interview with Martin Eden, the leader of the organized
menace to society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not object to having your picture taken, Mr. Eden?&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a staff photographer outside, you see,
and he says it will be better to take you right away before the sun
gets lower.&nbsp; Then we can have the interview afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A photographer,&rdquo; Brissenden said meditatively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Poke him, Martin!&nbsp; Poke him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m getting old,&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know I ought, but I really haven&rsquo;t the heart.&nbsp; It
doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For his mother&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; Brissenden urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth considering,&rdquo; Martin replied; &ldquo;but
it doesn&rsquo;t seem worth while enough to rouse sufficient energy
in me.&nbsp; You see, it does take energy to give a fellow a poking.&nbsp;
Besides, what does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way to take it,&rdquo;
the cub announced airily, though he had already begun to glance anxiously
at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t true, not a word of what he wrote,&rdquo;
Martin went on, confining his attention to Brissenden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just in a general way a description, you understand,&rdquo;
the cub ventured, &ldquo;and besides, it&rsquo;s good advertising.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what counts.&nbsp; It was a favor to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good advertising, Martin, old boy,&rdquo; Brissenden
repeated solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was a favor to me&mdash;think of that!&rdquo; was Martin&rsquo;s
contribution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see&mdash;where were you born, Mr. Eden?&rdquo; the
cub asked, assuming an air of expectant attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t take notes,&rdquo; said Brissenden.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He remembers it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is sufficient for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cub was trying
not to look worried.&nbsp; &ldquo;No decent reporter needs to bother
with notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was sufficient&mdash;for last night.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Brissenden was not a disciple of quietism, and he changed his attitude
abruptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Martin, if you don&rsquo;t poke him, I&rsquo;ll
do it myself, if I fall dead on the floor the next moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will a spanking do?&rdquo; Martin asked.</p>
<p>Brissenden considered judicially, and nodded his head.</p>
<p>The next instant Martin was seated on the edge of the bed with the
cub face downward across his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t bite,&rdquo; Martin warned, &ldquo;or else
I&rsquo;ll have to punch your face.&nbsp; It would be a pity, for it
is such a pretty face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His uplifted hand descended, and thereafter rose and fell in a swift
and steady rhythm.&nbsp; The cub struggled and cursed and squirmed,
but did not offer to bite.&nbsp; Brissenden looked on gravely, though
once he grew excited and gripped the whiskey bottle, pleading, &ldquo;Here,
just let me swat him once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry my hand played out,&rdquo; Martin said, when at last
he desisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is quite numb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He uprighted the cub and perched him on the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you arrested for this,&rdquo; he snarled,
tears of boyish indignation running down his flushed cheeks.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
make you sweat for this.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pretty thing,&rdquo; Martin remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
doesn&rsquo;t realize that he has entered upon the downward path.&nbsp;
It is not honest, it is not square, it is not manly, to tell lies about
one&rsquo;s fellow-creatures the way he has done, and he doesn&rsquo;t
know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has to come to us to be told,&rdquo; Brissenden filled
in a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to me whom he has maligned and injured.&nbsp; My grocery
will undoubtedly refuse me credit now.&nbsp; The worst of it is that
the poor boy will keep on this way until he deteriorates into a first-class
newspaper man and also a first-class scoundrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is yet time,&rdquo; quoth Brissenden.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
knows but what you may prove the humble instrument to save him.&nbsp;
Why didn&rsquo;t you let me swat him just once?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like
to have had a hand in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you arrested, the pair of you, you b-b-big
brutes,&rdquo; sobbed the erring soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, his mouth is too pretty and too weak.&rdquo;&nbsp; Martin
shook his head lugubriously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve
numbed my hand in vain.&nbsp; The young man cannot reform.&nbsp; He
will become eventually a very great and successful newspaper man.&nbsp;
He has no conscience.&nbsp; That alone will make him great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the cub passed out the door in trepidation to the last
for fear that Brissenden would hit him in the back with the bottle he
still clutched.</p>
<p>In the next morning&rsquo;s paper Martin learned a great deal more
about himself that was new to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are the sworn enemies
of society,&rdquo; he found himself quoted as saying in a column interview.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, we are not anarchists but socialists.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the
reporter pointed out to him that there seemed little difference between
the two schools, Martin had shrugged his shoulders in silent affirmation.&nbsp;
His face was described as bilaterally asymmetrical, and various other
signs of degeneration were described.&nbsp; Especially notable were
his thuglike hands and the fiery gleams in his blood-shot eyes.</p>
<p>He learned, also, that he spoke nightly to the workmen in the City
Hall Park, and that among the anarchists and agitators that there inflamed
the minds of the people he drew the largest audiences and made the most
revolutionary speeches.&nbsp; The cub painted a high-light picture of
his poor little room, its oil-stove and the one chair, and of the death&rsquo;s-head
tramp who kept him company and who looked as if he had just emerged
from twenty years of solitary confinement in some fortress dungeon.</p>
<p>The cub had been industrious.&nbsp; He had scurried around and nosed
out Martin&rsquo;s family history, and procured a photograph of Higginbotham&rsquo;s
Cash Store with Bernard Higginbotham himself standing out in front.&nbsp;
That gentleman was depicted as an intelligent, dignified businessman
who had no patience with his brother-in-law&rsquo;s socialistic views,
and no patience with the brother-in-law, either, whom he was quoted
as characterizing as a lazy good-for-nothing who wouldn&rsquo;t take
a job when it was offered to him and who would go to jail yet.&nbsp;
Hermann Von Schmidt, Marian&rsquo;s husband, had likewise been interviewed.&nbsp;
He had called Martin the black sheep of the family and repudiated him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He tried to sponge off of me, but I put a stop to that good and
quick,&rdquo; Von Schmidt had said to the reporter.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
knows better than to come bumming around here.&nbsp; A man who won&rsquo;t
work is no good, take that from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Martin was genuinely angry.&nbsp; Brissenden looked upon
the affair as a good joke, but he could not console Martin, who knew
that it would be no easy task to explain to Ruth.&nbsp; As for her father,
he knew that he must be overjoyed with what had happened and that he
would make the most of it to break off the engagement.&nbsp; How much
he would make of it he was soon to realize.&nbsp; The afternoon mail
brought a letter from Ruth.&nbsp; Martin opened it with a premonition
of disaster, and read it standing at the open door when he had received
it from the postman.&nbsp; As he read, mechanically his hand sought
his pocket for the tobacco and brown paper of his old cigarette days.&nbsp;
He was not aware that the pocket was empty or that he had even reached
for the materials with which to roll a cigarette.</p>
<p>It was not a passionate letter.&nbsp; There were no touches of anger
in it.&nbsp; But all the way through, from the first sentence to the
last, was sounded the note of hurt and disappointment.&nbsp; She had
expected better of him.&nbsp; She had thought he had got over his youthful
wildness, that her love for him had been sufficiently worth while to
enable him to live seriously and decently.&nbsp; And now her father
and mother had taken a firm stand and commanded that the engagement
be broken.&nbsp; That they were justified in this she could not but
admit.&nbsp; Their relation could never be a happy one.&nbsp; It had
been unfortunate from the first.&nbsp; But one regret she voiced in
the whole letter, and it was a bitter one to Martin.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
only you had settled down to some position and attempted to make something
of yourself,&rdquo; she wrote.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it was not to be.&nbsp;
Your past life had been too wild and irregular.&nbsp; I can understand
that you are not to be blamed.&nbsp; You could act only according to
your nature and your early training.&nbsp; So I do not blame you, Martin.&nbsp;
Please remember that.&nbsp; It was simply a mistake.&nbsp; As father
and mother have contended, we were not made for each other, and we should
both be happy because it was discovered not too late.&rdquo; . . &ldquo;There
is no use trying to see me,&rdquo; she said toward the last.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
would be an unhappy meeting for both of us, as well as for my mother.&nbsp;
I feel, as it is, that I have caused her great pain and worry.&nbsp;
I shall have to do much living to atone for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He read it through to the end, carefully, a second time, then sat
down and replied.&nbsp; He outlined the remarks he had uttered at the
socialist meeting, pointing out that they were in all ways the converse
of what the newspaper had put in his mouth.&nbsp; Toward the end of
the letter he was God&rsquo;s own lover pleading passionately for love.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Please answer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and in your answer you
have to tell me but one thing.&nbsp; Do you love me?&nbsp; That is all&mdash;the
answer to that one question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no answer came the next day, nor the next.&nbsp; &ldquo;Overdue&rdquo;
lay untouched upon the table, and each day the heap of returned manuscripts
under the table grew larger.&nbsp; For the first time Martin&rsquo;s
glorious sleep was interrupted by insomnia, and he tossed through long,
restless nights.&nbsp; Three times he called at the Morse home, but
was turned away by the servant who answered the bell.&nbsp; Brissenden
lay sick in his hotel, too feeble to stir out, and, though Martin was
with him often, he did not worry him with his troubles.</p>
<p>For Martin&rsquo;s troubles were many.&nbsp; The aftermath of the
cub reporter&rsquo;s deed was even wider than Martin had anticipated.&nbsp;
The Portuguese grocer refused him further credit, while the greengrocer,
who was an American and proud of it, had called him a traitor to his
country and refused further dealings with him&mdash;carrying his patriotism
to such a degree that he cancelled Martin&rsquo;s account and forbade
him ever to attempt to pay it.&nbsp; The talk in the neighborhood reflected
the same feeling, and indignation against Martin ran high.&nbsp; No
one would have anything to do with a socialist traitor.&nbsp; Poor Maria
was dubious and frightened, but she remained loyal.&nbsp; The children
of the neighborhood recovered from the awe of the grand carriage which
once had visited Martin, and from safe distances they called him &ldquo;hobo&rdquo;
and &ldquo;bum.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Silva tribe, however, stanchly defended
him, fighting more than one pitched battle for his honor, and black
eyes and bloody noses became quite the order of the day and added to
Maria&rsquo;s perplexities and troubles.</p>
<p>Once, Martin met Gertrude on the street, down in Oakland, and learned
what he knew could not be otherwise&mdash;that Bernard Higginbotham
was furious with him for having dragged the family into public disgrace,
and that he had forbidden him the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go away, Martin?&rdquo; Gertrude had begged.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go away and get a job somewhere and steady down.&nbsp; Afterwards,
when this all blows over, you can come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin shook his head, but gave no explanations.&nbsp; How could
he explain?&nbsp; He was appalled at the awful intellectual chasm that
yawned between him and his people.&nbsp; He could never cross it and
explain to them his position,&mdash;the Nietzschean position, in regard
to socialism.&nbsp; There were not words enough in the English language,
nor in any language, to make his attitude and conduct intelligible to
them.&nbsp; Their highest concept of right conduct, in his case, was
to get a job.&nbsp; That was their first word and their last.&nbsp;
It constituted their whole lexicon of ideas.&nbsp; Get a job!&nbsp;
Go to work!&nbsp; Poor, stupid slaves, he thought, while his sister
talked.&nbsp; Small wonder the world belonged to the strong.&nbsp; The
slaves were obsessed by their own slavery.&nbsp; A job was to them a
golden fetich before which they fell down and worshipped.</p>
<p>He shook his head again, when Gertrude offered him money, though
he knew that within the day he would have to make a trip to the pawnbroker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come near Bernard now,&rdquo; she admonished him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;After a few months, when he is cooled down, if you want to, you
can get the job of drivin&rsquo; delivery-wagon for him.&nbsp; Any time
you want me, just send for me an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll come.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went away weeping audibly, and he felt a pang of sorrow shoot
through him at sight of her heavy body and uncouth gait.&nbsp; As he
watched her go, the Nietzschean edifice seemed to shake and totter.&nbsp;
The slave-class in the abstract was all very well, but it was not wholly
satisfactory when it was brought home to his own family.&nbsp; And yet,
if there was ever a slave trampled by the strong, that slave was his
sister Gertrude.&nbsp; He grinned savagely at the paradox.&nbsp; A fine
Nietzsche-man he was, to allow his intellectual concepts to be shaken
by the first sentiment or emotion that strayed along&mdash;ay, to be
shaken by the slave-morality itself, for that was what his pity for
his sister really was.&nbsp; The true noble men were above pity and
compassion.&nbsp; Pity and compassion had been generated in the subterranean
barracoons of the slaves and were no more than the agony and sweat of
the crowded miserables and weaklings.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Overdue&rdquo; still continued to lie forgotten on the table.&nbsp;
Every manuscript that he had had out now lay under the table.&nbsp;
Only one manuscript he kept going, and that was Brissenden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ephemera.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His bicycle and black suit were again in pawn, and the type-writer people
were once more worrying about the rent.&nbsp; But such things no longer
bothered him.&nbsp; He was seeking a new orientation, and until that
was found his life must stand still.</p>
<p>After several weeks, what he had been waiting for happened.&nbsp;
He met Ruth on the street.&nbsp; It was true, she was accompanied by
her brother, Norman, and it was true that they tried to ignore him and
that Norman attempted to wave him aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you interfere with my sister, I&rsquo;ll call an officer,&rdquo;
Norman threatened.&nbsp; &ldquo;She does not wish to speak with you,
and your insistence is insult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you persist, you&rsquo;ll have to call that officer, and
then you&rsquo;ll get your name in the papers,&rdquo; Martin answered
grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now, get out of my way and get the officer
if you want to.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to talk with Ruth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to have it from your own lips,&rdquo; he said to her.</p>
<p>She was pale and trembling, but she held up and looked inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question I asked in my letter,&rdquo; he prompted.</p>
<p>Norman made an impatient movement, but Martin checked him with a
swift look.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is all this of your own free will?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;&nbsp; She spoke in a low, firm voice and with
deliberation.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is of my own free will.&nbsp; You have
disgraced me so that I am ashamed to meet my friends.&nbsp; They are
all talking about me, I know.&nbsp; That is all I can tell you.&nbsp;
You have made me very unhappy, and I never wish to see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends!&nbsp; Gossip!&nbsp; Newspaper misreports!&nbsp; Surely
such things are not stronger than love!&nbsp; I can only believe that
you never loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A blush drove the pallor from her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After what has passed?&rdquo; she said faintly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Martin,
you do not know what you are saying.&nbsp; I am not common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, she doesn&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with
you,&rdquo; Norman blurted out, starting on with her.</p>
<p>Martin stood aside and let them pass, fumbling unconsciously in his
coat pocket for the tobacco and brown papers that were not there.</p>
<p>It was a long walk to North Oakland, but it was not until he went
up the steps and entered his room that he knew he had walked it.&nbsp;
He found himself sitting on the edge of the bed and staring about him
like an awakened somnambulist.&nbsp; He noticed &ldquo;Overdue&rdquo;
lying on the table and drew up his chair and reached for his pen.&nbsp;
There was in his nature a logical compulsion toward completeness.&nbsp;
Here was something undone.&nbsp; It had been deferred against the completion
of something else.&nbsp; Now that something else had been finished,
and he would apply himself to this task until it was finished.&nbsp;
What he would do next he did not know.&nbsp; All that he did know was
that a climacteric in his life had been attained.&nbsp; A period had
been reached, and he was rounding it off in workman-like fashion.&nbsp;
He was not curious about the future.&nbsp; He would soon enough find
out what it held in store for him.&nbsp; Whatever it was, it did not
matter.&nbsp; Nothing seemed to matter.</p>
<p>For five days he toiled on at &ldquo;Overdue,&rdquo; going nowhere,
seeing nobody, and eating meagrely.&nbsp; On the morning of the sixth
day the postman brought him a thin letter from the editor of <i>The
Parthenon</i>.&nbsp; A glance told him that &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; was
accepted.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have submitted the poem to Mr. Cartwright
Bruce,&rdquo; the editor went on to say, &ldquo;and he has reported
so favorably upon it that we cannot let it go.&nbsp; As an earnest of
our pleasure in publishing the poem, let me tell you that we have set
it for the August number, our July number being already made up.&nbsp;
Kindly extend our pleasure and our thanks to Mr. Brissenden.&nbsp; Please
send by return mail his photograph and biographical data.&nbsp; If our
honorarium is unsatisfactory, kindly telegraph us at once and state
what you consider a fair price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the honorarium they had offered was three hundred and fifty
dollars, Martin thought it not worth while to telegraph.&nbsp; Then,
too, there was Brissenden&rsquo;s consent to be gained.&nbsp; Well,
he had been right, after all.&nbsp; Here was one magazine editor who
knew real poetry when he saw it.&nbsp; And the price was splendid, even
though it was for the poem of a century.&nbsp; As for Cartwright Bruce,
Martin knew that he was the one critic for whose opinions Brissenden
had any respect.</p>
<p>Martin rode down town on an electric car, and as he watched the houses
and cross-streets slipping by he was aware of a regret that he was not
more elated over his friend&rsquo;s success and over his own signal
victory.&nbsp; The one critic in the United States had pronounced favorably
on the poem, while his own contention that good stuff could find its
way into the magazines had proved correct.&nbsp; But enthusiasm had
lost its spring in him, and he found that he was more anxious to see
Brissenden than he was to carry the good news.&nbsp; The acceptance
of <i>The Parthenon</i> had recalled to him that during his five days&rsquo;
devotion to &ldquo;Overdue&rdquo; he had not heard from Brissenden nor
even thought about him.&nbsp; For the first time Martin realized the
daze he had been in, and he felt shame for having forgotten his friend.&nbsp;
But even the shame did not burn very sharply.&nbsp; He was numb to emotions
of any sort save the artistic ones concerned in the writing of &ldquo;Overdue.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So far as other affairs were concerned, he had been in a trance.&nbsp;
For that matter, he was still in a trance.&nbsp; All this life through
which the electric car whirred seemed remote and unreal, and he would
have experienced little interest and less shock if the great stone steeple
of the church he passed had suddenly crumbled to mortar-dust upon his
head.</p>
<p>At the hotel he hurried up to Brissenden&rsquo;s room, and hurried
down again.&nbsp; The room was empty.&nbsp; All luggage was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mr. Brissenden leave any address?&rdquo; he asked the
clerk, who looked at him curiously for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Martin shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the papers were full of it.&nbsp; He was found dead in
bed.&nbsp; Suicide.&nbsp; Shot himself through the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he buried yet?&rdquo; Martin seemed to hear his voice,
like some one else&rsquo;s voice, from a long way off, asking the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; The body was shipped East after the inquest.&nbsp;
Lawyers engaged by his people saw to the arrangements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were quick about it, I must say,&rdquo; Martin commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; It happened five days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five days ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, five days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Martin said as he turned and went out.</p>
<p>At the corner he stepped into the Western Union and sent a telegram
to <i>The Parthenon</i>, advising them to proceed with the publication
of the poem.&nbsp; He had in his pocket but five cents with which to
pay his carfare home, so he sent the message collect.</p>
<p>Once in his room, he resumed his writing.&nbsp; The days and nights
came and went, and he sat at his table and wrote on.&nbsp; He went nowhere,
save to the pawnbroker, took no exercise, and ate methodically when
he was hungry and had something to cook, and just as methodically went
without when he had nothing to cook.&nbsp; Composed as the story was,
in advance, chapter by chapter, he nevertheless saw and developed an
opening that increased the power of it, though it necessitated twenty
thousand additional words.&nbsp; It was not that there was any vital
need that the thing should be well done, but that his artistic canons
compelled him to do it well.&nbsp; He worked on in the daze, strangely
detached from the world around him, feeling like a familiar ghost among
these literary trappings of his former life.&nbsp; He remembered that
some one had said that a ghost was the spirit of a man who was dead
and who did not have sense enough to know it; and he paused for the
moment to wonder if he were really dead and unaware of it.</p>
<p>Came the day when &ldquo;Overdue&rdquo; was finished.&nbsp; The agent
of the type-writer firm had come for the machine, and he sat on the
bed while Martin, on the one chair, typed the last pages of the final
chapter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Finis,&rdquo; he wrote, in capitals, at the end,
and to him it was indeed finis.&nbsp; He watched the type-writer carried
out the door with a feeling of relief, then went over and lay down on
the bed.&nbsp; He was faint from hunger.&nbsp; Food had not passed his
lips in thirty-six hours, but he did not think about it.&nbsp; He lay
on his back, with closed eyes, and did not think at all, while the daze
or stupor slowly welled up, saturating his consciousness.&nbsp; Half
in delirium, he began muttering aloud the lines of an anonymous poem
Brissenden had been fond of quoting to him.&nbsp; Maria, listening anxiously
outside his door, was perturbed by his monotonous utterance.&nbsp; The
words in themselves were not significant to her, but the fact that he
was saying them was.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have done,&rdquo; was the burden
of the poem.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have done&mdash;<br />
Put by the lute.<br />
Song and singing soon are over<br />
As the airy shades that hover<br />
In among the purple clover.<br />
I have done&mdash;<br />
Put by the lute.<br />
Once I sang as early thrushes<br />
Sing among the dewy bushes;<br />
Now I&rsquo;m mute.<br />
I am like a weary linnet,<br />
For my throat has no song in it;<br />
I have had my singing minute.<br />
I have done.<br />
Put by the lute.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maria could stand it no longer, and hurried away to the stove, where
she filled a quart-bowl with soup, putting into it the lion&rsquo;s
share of chopped meat and vegetables which her ladle scraped from the
bottom of the pot.&nbsp; Martin roused himself and sat up and began
to eat, between spoonfuls reassuring Maria that he had not been talking
in his sleep and that he did not have any fever.</p>
<p>After she left him he sat drearily, with drooping shoulders, on the
edge of the bed, gazing about him with lack-lustre eyes that saw nothing
until the torn wrapper of a magazine, which had come in the morning&rsquo;s
mail and which lay unopened, shot a gleam of light into his darkened
brain.&nbsp; It is <i>The Parthenon</i>, he thought, the August <i>Parthenon</i>,
and it must contain &ldquo;Ephemera.&rdquo;&nbsp; If only Brissenden
were here to see!</p>
<p>He was turning the pages of the magazine, when suddenly he stopped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; had been featured, with gorgeous head-piece and
Beardsley-like margin decorations.&nbsp; On one side of the head-piece
was Brissenden&rsquo;s photograph, on the other side was the photograph
of Sir John Value, the British Ambassador.&nbsp; A preliminary editorial
note quoted Sir John Value as saying that there were no poets in America,
and the publication of &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; was <i>The Parthenon&rsquo;s</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There, take that, Sir John Value!&rdquo;&nbsp; Cartwright Bruce
was described as the greatest critic in America, and he was quoted as
saying that &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; was the greatest poem ever written
in America.&nbsp; And finally, the editor&rsquo;s foreword ended with:
&ldquo;We have not yet made up our minds entirely as to the merits of
&ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo;; perhaps we shall never be able to do so.&nbsp;
But we have read it often, wondering at the words and their arrangement,
wondering where Mr. Brissenden got them, and how he could fasten them
together.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then followed the poem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty good thing you died, Briss, old man,&rdquo; Martin
murmured, letting the magazine slip between his knees to the floor.</p>
<p>The cheapness and vulgarity of it was nauseating, and Martin noted
apathetically that he was not nauseated very much.&nbsp; He wished he
could get angry, but did not have energy enough to try.&nbsp; He was
too numb.&nbsp; His blood was too congealed to accelerate to the swift
tidal flow of indignation.&nbsp; After all, what did it matter?&nbsp;
It was on a par with all the rest that Brissenden had condemned in bourgeois
society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Briss,&rdquo; Martin communed; &ldquo;he would never
have forgiven me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rousing himself with an effort, he possessed himself of a box which
had once contained type-writer paper.&nbsp; Going through its contents,
he drew forth eleven poems which his friend had written.&nbsp; These
he tore lengthwise and crosswise and dropped into the waste basket.&nbsp;
He did it languidly, and, when he had finished, sat on the edge of the
bed staring blankly before him.</p>
<p>How long he sat there he did not know, until, suddenly, across his
sightless vision he saw form a long horizontal line of white.&nbsp;
It was curious.&nbsp; But as he watched it grow in definiteness he saw
that it was a coral reef smoking in the white Pacific surges.&nbsp;
Next, in the line of breakers he made out a small canoe, an outrigger
canoe.&nbsp; In the stern he saw a young bronzed god in scarlet hip-cloth
dipping a flashing paddle.&nbsp; He recognized him.&nbsp; He was Moti,
the youngest son of Tati, the chief, and this was Tahiti, and beyond
that smoking reef lay the sweet land of Papara and the chief&rsquo;s
grass house by the river&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; It was the end of the
day, and Moti was coming home from the fishing.&nbsp; He was waiting
for the rush of a big breaker whereon to jump the reef.&nbsp; Then he
saw himself, sitting forward in the canoe as he had often sat in the
past, dipping a paddle that waited Moti&rsquo;s word to dig in like
mad when the turquoise wall of the great breaker rose behind them.&nbsp;
Next, he was no longer an onlooker but was himself in the canoe, Moti
was crying out, they were both thrusting hard with their paddles, racing
on the steep face of the flying turquoise.&nbsp; Under the bow the water
was hissing as from a steam jet, the air was filled with driven spray,
there was a rush and rumble and long-echoing roar, and the canoe floated
on the placid water of the lagoon.&nbsp; Moti laughed and shook the
salt water from his eyes, and together they paddled in to the pounded-coral
beach where Tati&rsquo;s grass walls through the cocoanut-palms showed
golden in the setting sun.</p>
<p>The picture faded, and before his eyes stretched the disorder of
his squalid room.&nbsp; He strove in vain to see Tahiti again.&nbsp;
He knew there was singing among the trees and that the maidens were
dancing in the moonlight, but he could not see them.&nbsp; He could
see only the littered writing-table, the empty space where the type-writer
had stood, and the unwashed window-pane.&nbsp; He closed his eyes with
a groan, and slept.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLI</h2>
<p>He slept heavily all night, and did not stir until aroused by the
postman on his morning round.&nbsp; Martin felt tired and passive, and
went through his letters aimlessly.&nbsp; One thin envelope, from a
robber magazine, contained for twenty-two dollars.&nbsp; He had been
dunning for it for a year and a half.&nbsp; He noted its amount apathetically.&nbsp;
The old-time thrill at receiving a publisher&rsquo;s check was gone.&nbsp;
Unlike his earlier checks, this one was not pregnant with promise of
great things to come.&nbsp; To him it was a check for twenty-two dollars,
that was all, and it would buy him something to eat.</p>
<p>Another check was in the same mail, sent from a New York weekly in
payment for some humorous verse which had been accepted months before.&nbsp;
It was for ten dollars.&nbsp; An idea came to him, which he calmly considered.&nbsp;
He did not know what he was going to do, and he felt in no hurry to
do anything.&nbsp; In the meantime he must live.&nbsp; Also he owed
numerous debts.&nbsp; Would it not be a paying investment to put stamps
on the huge pile of manuscripts under the table and start them on their
travels again?&nbsp; One or two of them might be accepted.&nbsp; That
would help him to live.&nbsp; He decided on the investment, and, after
he had cashed the checks at the bank down in Oakland, he bought ten
dollars&rsquo; worth of postage stamps.&nbsp; The thought of going home
to cook breakfast in his stuffy little room was repulsive to him.&nbsp;
For the first time he refused to consider his debts.&nbsp; He knew that
in his room he could manufacture a substantial breakfast at a cost of
from fifteen to twenty cents.&nbsp; But, instead, he went into the Forum
Caf&eacute; and ordered a breakfast that cost two dollars.&nbsp; He
tipped the waiter a quarter, and spent fifty cents for a package of
Egyptian cigarettes.&nbsp; It was the first time he had smoked since
Ruth had asked him to stop.&nbsp; But he could see now no reason why
he should not, and besides, he wanted to smoke.&nbsp; And what did the
money matter?&nbsp; For five cents he could have bought a package of
Durham and brown papers and rolled forty cigarettes&mdash;but what of
it?&nbsp; Money had no meaning to him now except what it would immediately
buy.&nbsp; He was chartless and rudderless, and he had no port to make,
while drifting involved the least living, and it was living that hurt.</p>
<p>The days slipped along, and he slept eight hours regularly every
night.&nbsp; Though now, while waiting for more checks, he ate in the
Japanese restaurants where meals were served for ten cents, his wasted
body filled out, as did the hollows in his cheeks.&nbsp; He no longer
abused himself with short sleep, overwork, and overstudy.&nbsp; He wrote
nothing, and the books were closed.&nbsp; He walked much, out in the
hills, and loafed long hours in the quiet parks.&nbsp; He had no friends
nor acquaintances, nor did he make any.&nbsp; He had no inclination.&nbsp;
He was waiting for some impulse, from he knew not where, to put his
stopped life into motion again.&nbsp; In the meantime his life remained
run down, planless, and empty and idle.</p>
<p>Once he made a trip to San Francisco to look up the &ldquo;real dirt.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But at the last moment, as he stepped into the upstairs entrance, he
recoiled and turned and fled through the swarming ghetto.&nbsp; He was
frightened at the thought of hearing philosophy discussed, and he fled
furtively, for fear that some one of the &ldquo;real dirt&rdquo; might
chance along and recognize him.</p>
<p>Sometimes he glanced over the magazines and newspapers to see how
&ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; was being maltreated.&nbsp; It had made a hit.&nbsp;
But what a hit!&nbsp; Everybody had read it, and everybody was discussing
whether or not it was really poetry.&nbsp; The local papers had taken
it up, and daily there appeared columns of learned criticisms, facetious
editorials, and serious letters from subscribers.&nbsp; Helen Della
Delmar (proclaimed with a flourish of trumpets and rolling of tomtoms
to be the greatest woman poet in the United States) denied Brissenden
a seat beside her on Pegasus and wrote voluminous letters to the public,
proving that he was no poet.</p>
<p><i>The Parthenon</i> came out in its next number patting itself on
the back for the stir it had made, sneering at Sir John Value, and exploiting
Brissenden&rsquo;s death with ruthless commercialism.&nbsp; A newspaper
with a sworn circulation of half a million published an original and
spontaneous poem by Helen Della Delmar, in which she gibed and sneered
at Brissenden.&nbsp; Also, she was guilty of a second poem, in which
she parodied him.</p>
<p>Martin had many times to be glad that Brissenden was dead.&nbsp;
He had hated the crowd so, and here all that was finest and most sacred
of him had been thrown to the crowd.&nbsp; Daily the vivisection of
Beauty went on.&nbsp; Every nincompoop in the land rushed into free
print, floating their wizened little egos into the public eye on the
surge of Brissenden&rsquo;s greatness.&nbsp; Quoth one paper: &ldquo;We
have received a letter from a gentleman who wrote a poem just like it,
only better, some time ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another paper, in deadly seriousness,
reproving Helen Della Delmar for her parody, said: &ldquo;But unquestionably
Miss Delmar wrote it in a moment of badinage and not quite with the
respect that one great poet should show to another and perhaps to the
greatest.&nbsp; However, whether Miss Delmar be jealous or not of the
man who invented &lsquo;Ephemera,&rsquo; it is certain that she, like
thousands of others, is fascinated by his work, and that the day may
come when she will try to write lines like his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ministers began to preach sermons against &ldquo;Ephemera,&rdquo;
and one, who too stoutly stood for much of its content, was expelled
for heresy.&nbsp; The great poem contributed to the gayety of the world.&nbsp;
The comic verse-writers and the cartoonists took hold of it with screaming
laughter, and in the personal columns of society weeklies jokes were
perpetrated on it to the effect that Charley Frensham told Archie Jennings,
in confidence, that five lines of &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; would drive
a man to beat a cripple, and that ten lines would send him to the bottom
of the river.</p>
<p>Martin did not laugh; nor did he grit his teeth in anger.&nbsp; The
effect produced upon him was one of great sadness.&nbsp; In the crash
of his whole world, with love on the pinnacle, the crash of magazinedom
and the dear public was a small crash indeed.&nbsp; Brissenden had been
wholly right in his judgment of the magazines, and he, Martin, had spent
arduous and futile years in order to find it out for himself.&nbsp;
The magazines were all Brissenden had said they were and more.&nbsp;
Well, he was done, he solaced himself.&nbsp; He had hitched his wagon
to a star and been landed in a pestiferous marsh.&nbsp; The visions
of Tahiti&mdash;clean, sweet Tahiti&mdash;were coming to him more frequently.&nbsp;
And there were the low Paumotus, and the high Marquesas; he saw himself
often, now, on board trading schooners or frail little cutters, slipping
out at dawn through the reef at Papeete and beginning the long beat
through the pearl-atolls to Nukahiva and the Bay of Taiohae, where Tamari,
he knew, would kill a pig in honor of his coming, and where Tamari&rsquo;s
flower-garlanded daughters would seize his hands and with song and laughter
garland him with flowers.&nbsp; The South Seas were calling, and he
knew that sooner or later he would answer the call.</p>
<p>In the meantime he drifted, resting and recuperating after the long
traverse he had made through the realm of knowledge.&nbsp; When <i>The
Parthenon</i> check of three hundred and fifty dollars was forwarded
to him, he turned it over to the local lawyer who had attended to Brissenden&rsquo;s
affairs for his family.&nbsp; Martin took a receipt for the check, and
at the same time gave a note for the hundred dollars Brissenden had
let him have.</p>
<p>The time was not long when Martin ceased patronizing the Japanese
restaurants.&nbsp; At the very moment when he had abandoned the fight,
the tide turned.&nbsp; But it had turned too late.&nbsp; Without a thrill
he opened a thick envelope from <i>The Millennium</i>, scanned the face
of a check that represented three hundred dollars, and noted that it
was the payment on acceptance for &ldquo;Adventure.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every
debt he owed in the world, including the pawnshop, with its usurious
interest, amounted to less than a hundred dollars.&nbsp; And when he
had paid everything, and lifted the hundred-dollar note with Brissenden&rsquo;s
lawyer, he still had over a hundred dollars in pocket.&nbsp; He ordered
a suit of clothes from the tailor and ate his meals in the best caf&eacute;s
in town.&nbsp; He still slept in his little room at Maria&rsquo;s, but
the sight of his new clothes caused the neighborhood children to cease
from calling him &ldquo;hobo&rdquo; and &ldquo;tramp&rdquo; from the
roofs of woodsheds and over back fences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wiki-Wiki,&rdquo; his Hawaiian short story, was bought by
<i>Warren&rsquo;s Monthly</i> for two hundred and fifty dollars.&nbsp;
<i>The Northern Review</i> took his essay, &ldquo;The Cradle of Beauty,&rdquo;
and <i>Mackintosh&rsquo;s Magazine</i> took &ldquo;The Palmist&rdquo;&mdash;the
poem he had written to Marian.&nbsp; The editors and readers were back
from their summer vacations, and manuscripts were being handled quickly.&nbsp;
But Martin could not puzzle out what strange whim animated them to this
general acceptance of the things they had persistently rejected for
two years.&nbsp; Nothing of his had been published.&nbsp; He was not
known anywhere outside of Oakland, and in Oakland, with the few who
thought they knew him, he was notorious as a red-shirt and a socialist.&nbsp;
So there was no explaining this sudden acceptability of his wares.&nbsp;
It was sheer jugglery of fate.</p>
<p>After it had been refused by a number of magazines, he had taken
Brissenden&rsquo;s rejected advice and started, &ldquo;The Shame of
the Sun&rdquo; on the round of publishers.&nbsp; After several refusals,
Singletree, Darnley &amp; Co. accepted it, promising fall publication.&nbsp;
When Martin asked for an advance on royalties, they wrote that such
was not their custom, that books of that nature rarely paid for themselves,
and that they doubted if his book would sell a thousand copies.&nbsp;
Martin figured what the book would earn him on such a sale.&nbsp; Retailed
at a dollar, on a royalty of fifteen per cent, it would bring him one
hundred and fifty dollars.&nbsp; He decided that if he had it to do
over again he would confine himself to fiction.&nbsp; &ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo;
one-fourth as long, had brought him twice as much from <i>The Millennium</i>.&nbsp;
That newspaper paragraph he had read so long ago had been true, after
all.&nbsp; The first-class magazines did not pay on acceptance, and
they paid well.&nbsp; Not two cents a word, but four cents a word, had
<i>The Millennium</i> paid him.&nbsp; And, furthermore, they bought
good stuff, too, for were they not buying his?&nbsp; This last thought
he accompanied with a grin.</p>
<p>He wrote to Singletree, Darnley &amp; Co., offering to sell out his
rights in &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun&rdquo; for a hundred dollars,
but they did not care to take the risk.&nbsp; In the meantime he was
not in need of money, for several of his later stories had been accepted
and paid for.&nbsp; He actually opened a bank account, where, without
a debt in the world, he had several hundred dollars to his credit.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Overdue,&rdquo; after having been declined by a number of magazines,
came to rest at the Meredith-Lowell Company.&nbsp; Martin remembered
the five dollars Gertrude had given him, and his resolve to return it
to her a hundred times over; so he wrote for an advance on royalties
of five hundred dollars.&nbsp; To his surprise a check for that amount,
accompanied by a contract, came by return mail.&nbsp; He cashed the
check into five-dollar gold pieces and telephoned Gertrude that he wanted
to see her.</p>
<p>She arrived at the house panting and short of breath from the haste
she had made.&nbsp; Apprehensive of trouble, she had stuffed the few
dollars she possessed into her hand-satchel; and so sure was she that
disaster had overtaken her brother, that she stumbled forward, sobbing,
into his arms, at the same time thrusting the satchel mutely at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have come myself,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I didn&rsquo;t want a row with Mr. Higginbotham, and that is what would
have surely happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right after a time,&rdquo; she assured
him, while she wondered what the trouble was that Martin was in.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d best get a job first an&rsquo; steady down.&nbsp;
Bernard does like to see a man at honest work.&nbsp; That stuff in the
newspapers broke &rsquo;m all up.&nbsp; I never saw &rsquo;m so mad
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to get a job,&rdquo; Martin said with
a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you can tell him so from me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
need a job, and there&rsquo;s the proof of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He emptied the hundred gold pieces into her lap in a glinting, tinkling
stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that fiver you gave me the time I didn&rsquo;t
have carfare?&nbsp; Well, there it is, with ninety-nine brothers of
different ages but all of the same size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Gertrude had been frightened when she arrived, she was now in
a panic of fear.&nbsp; Her fear was such that it was certitude.&nbsp;
She was not suspicious.&nbsp; She was convinced.&nbsp; She looked at
Martin in horror, and her heavy limbs shrank under the golden stream
as though it were burning her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yours,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>She burst into tears, and began to moan, &ldquo;My poor boy, my poor
boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was puzzled for a moment.&nbsp; Then he divined the cause of her
agitation and handed her the Meredith-Lowell letter which had accompanied
the check.&nbsp; She stumbled through it, pausing now and again to wipe
her eyes, and when she had finished, said:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; does it mean that you come by the money honestly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More honestly than if I&rsquo;d won it in a lottery.&nbsp;
I earned it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly faith came back to her, and she reread the letter carefully.&nbsp;
It took him long to explain to her the nature of the transaction which
had put the money into his possession, and longer still to get her to
understand that the money was really hers and that he did not need it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put it in the bank for you,&rdquo; she said finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s yours,
to do with as you please, and if you won&rsquo;t take it, I&rsquo;ll
give it to Maria.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll know what to do with it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d suggest, though, that you hire a servant and take a good long
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to tell Bernard all about it,&rdquo;
she announced, when she was leaving.</p>
<p>Martin winced, then grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then, maybe, he&rsquo;ll
invite me to dinner again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he will&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure he will!&rdquo; she exclaimed
fervently, as she drew him to her and kissed and hugged him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLII</h2>
<p>One day Martin became aware that he was lonely.&nbsp; He was healthy
and strong, and had nothing to do.&nbsp; The cessation from writing
and studying, the death of Brissenden, and the estrangement from Ruth
had made a big hole in his life; and his life refused to be pinned down
to good living in caf&eacute;s and the smoking of Egyptian cigarettes.&nbsp;
It was true the South Seas were calling to him, but he had a feeling
that the game was not yet played out in the United States.&nbsp; Two
books were soon to be published, and he had more books that might find
publication.&nbsp; Money could be made out of them, and he would wait
and take a sackful of it into the South Seas.&nbsp; He knew a valley
and a bay in the Marquesas that he could buy for a thousand Chili dollars.&nbsp;
The valley ran from the horseshoe, land-locked bay to the tops of the
dizzy, cloud-capped peaks and contained perhaps ten thousand acres.&nbsp;
It was filled with tropical fruits, wild chickens, and wild pigs, with
an occasional herd of wild cattle, while high up among the peaks were
herds of wild goats harried by packs of wild dogs.&nbsp; The whole place
was wild.&nbsp; Not a human lived in it. And he could buy it and the
bay for a thousand Chili dollars.</p>
<p>The bay, as he remembered it, was magnificent, with water deep enough
to accommodate the largest vessel afloat, and so safe that the South
Pacific Directory recommended it to the best careening place for ships
for hundreds of miles around.&nbsp; He would buy a schooner&mdash;one
of those yacht-like, coppered crafts that sailed like witches&mdash;and
go trading copra and pearling among the islands.&nbsp; He would make
the valley and the bay his headquarters.&nbsp; He would build a patriarchal
grass house like Tati&rsquo;s, and have it and the valley and the schooner
filled with dark-skinned servitors.&nbsp; He would entertain there the
factor of Taiohae, captains of wandering traders, and all the best of
the South Pacific riffraff.&nbsp; He would keep open house and entertain
like a prince.&nbsp; And he would forget the books he had opened and
the world that had proved an illusion.</p>
<p>To do all this he must wait in California to fill the sack with money.&nbsp;
Already it was beginning to flow in.&nbsp; If one of the books made
a strike, it might enable him to sell the whole heap of manuscripts.&nbsp;
Also he could collect the stories and the poems into books, and make
sure of the valley and the bay and the schooner.&nbsp; He would never
write again.&nbsp; Upon that he was resolved.&nbsp; But in the meantime,
awaiting the publication of the books, he must do something more than
live dazed and stupid in the sort of uncaring trance into which he had
fallen.</p>
<p>He noted, one Sunday morning, that the Bricklayers&rsquo; Picnic
took place that day at Shell Mound Park, and to Shell Mound Park he
went.&nbsp; He had been to the working-class picnics too often in his
earlier life not to know what they were like, and as he entered the
park he experienced a recrudescence of all the old sensations.&nbsp;
After all, they were his kind, these working people.&nbsp; He had been
born among them, he had lived among them, and though he had strayed
for a time, it was well to come back among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t Mart!&rdquo; he heard some one say, and
the next moment a hearty hand was on his shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where
you ben all the time?&nbsp; Off to sea?&nbsp; Come on an&rsquo; have
a drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the old crowd in which he found himself&mdash;the old crowd,
with here and there a gap, and here and there a new face.&nbsp; The
fellows were not bricklayers, but, as in the old days, they attended
all Sunday picnics for the dancing, and the fighting, and the fun.&nbsp;
Martin drank with them, and began to feel really human once more.&nbsp;
He was a fool to have ever left them, he thought; and he was very certain
that his sum of happiness would have been greater had he remained with
them and let alone the books and the people who sat in the high places.&nbsp;
Yet the beer seemed not so good as of yore.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t taste
as it used to taste.&nbsp; Brissenden had spoiled him for steam beer,
he concluded, and wondered if, after all, the books had spoiled him
for companionship with these friends of his youth.&nbsp; He resolved
that he would not be so spoiled, and he went on to the dancing pavilion.&nbsp;
Jimmy, the plumber, he met there, in the company of a tall, blond girl
who promptly forsook him for Martin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, it&rsquo;s like old times,&rdquo; Jimmy explained to
the gang that gave him the laugh as Martin and the blonde whirled away
in a waltz.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t give a rap.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
too damned glad to see &rsquo;m back.&nbsp; Watch &rsquo;m waltz, eh?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s like silk.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;d blame any girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Martin restored the blonde to Jimmy, and the three of them, with
half a dozen friends, watched the revolving couples and laughed and
joked with one another.&nbsp; Everybody was glad to see Martin back.&nbsp;
No book of his been published; he carried no fictitious value in their
eyes.&nbsp; They liked him for himself.&nbsp; He felt like a prince
returned from excile, and his lonely heart burgeoned in the geniality
in which it bathed.&nbsp; He made a mad day of it, and was at his best.&nbsp;
Also, he had money in his pockets, and, as in the old days when he returned
from sea with a pay-day, he made the money fly.</p>
<p>Once, on the dancing-floor, he saw Lizzie Connolly go by in the arms
of a young workingman; and, later, when he made the round of the pavilion,
he came upon her sitting by a refreshment table.&nbsp; Surprise and
greetings over, he led her away into the grounds, where they could talk
without shouting down the music.&nbsp; From the instant he spoke to
her, she was his.&nbsp; He knew it.&nbsp; She showed it in the proud
humility of her eyes, in every caressing movement of her proudly carried
body, and in the way she hung upon his speech.&nbsp; She was not the
young girl as he had known her.&nbsp; She was a woman, now, and Martin
noted that her wild, defiant beauty had improved, losing none of its
wildness, while the defiance and the fire seemed more in control.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A beauty, a perfect beauty,&rdquo; he murmured admiringly under
his breath.&nbsp; And he knew she was his, that all he had to do was
to say &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; and she would go with him over the world
wherever he led.</p>
<p>Even as the thought flashed through his brain he received a heavy
blow on the side of his head that nearly knocked him down.&nbsp; It
was a man&rsquo;s fist, directed by a man so angry and in such haste
that the fist had missed the jaw for which it was aimed.&nbsp; Martin
turned as he staggered, and saw the fist coming at him in a wild swing.&nbsp;
Quite as a matter of course he ducked, and the fist flew harmlessly
past, pivoting the man who had driven it.&nbsp; Martin hooked with his
left, landing on the pivoting man with the weight of his body behind
the blow.&nbsp; The man went to the ground sidewise, leaped to his feet,
and made a mad rush.&nbsp; Martin saw his passion-distorted face and
wondered what could be the cause of the fellow&rsquo;s anger.&nbsp;
But while he wondered, he shot in a straight left, the weight of his
body behind the blow.&nbsp; The man went over backward and fell in a
crumpled heap.&nbsp; Jimmy and others of the gang were running toward
them.</p>
<p>Martin was thrilling all over.&nbsp; This was the old days with a
vengeance, with their dancing, and their fighting, and their fun.&nbsp;
While he kept a wary eye on his antagonist, he glanced at Lizzie.&nbsp;
Usually the girls screamed when the fellows got to scrapping, but she
had not screamed.&nbsp; She was looking on with bated breath, leaning
slightly forward, so keen was her interest, one hand pressed to her
breast, her cheek flushed, and in her eyes a great and amazed admiration.</p>
<p>The man had gained his feet and was struggling to escape the restraining
arms that were laid on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was waitin&rsquo; for me to come back!&rdquo; he was proclaiming
to all and sundry.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was waitin&rsquo; for me to come
back, an&rsquo; then that fresh guy comes buttin&rsquo; in.&nbsp; Let
go o&rsquo; me, I tell yeh.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to fix &rsquo;m.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; yer?&rdquo; Jimmy was demanding,
as he helped hold the young fellow back.&nbsp; &ldquo;That guy&rsquo;s
Mart Eden.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s nifty with his mits, lemme tell you that,
an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll eat you alive if you monkey with &rsquo;m.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t steal her on me that way,&rdquo; the other
interjected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He licked the Flyin&rsquo; Dutchman, an&rsquo; you know <i>him</i>,&rdquo;
Jimmy went on expostulating.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; he did it in five
rounds.&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t last a minute against him.&nbsp; See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This information seemed to have a mollifying effect, and the irate
young man favored Martin with a measuring stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t look it,&rdquo; he sneered; but the sneer was
without passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the Flyin&rsquo; Dutchman thought,&rdquo;
Jimmy assured him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on, now, let&rsquo;s get outa this.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s lots of other girls.&nbsp; Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young fellow allowed himself to be led away toward the pavilion,
and the gang followed after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Martin asked Lizzie.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s
it all about, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already the zest of combat, which of old had been so keen and lasting,
had died down, and he discovered that he was self-analytical, too much
so to live, single heart and single hand, so primitive an existence.</p>
<p>Lizzie tossed her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s nobody,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
just ben keepin&rsquo; company with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to, you see,&rdquo; she explained after a pause.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was gettin&rsquo; pretty lonesome.&nbsp; But I never forgot.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Her voice sank lower, and she looked straight before her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
throw &rsquo;m down for you any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin looking at her averted face, knowing that all he had to do
was to reach out his hand and pluck her, fell to pondering whether,
after all, there was any real worth in refined, grammatical English,
and, so, forgot to reply to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You put it all over him,&rdquo; she said tentatively, with
a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a husky young fellow, though,&rdquo; he admitted
generously.&nbsp; &ldquo;If they hadn&rsquo;t taken him away, he might
have given me my hands full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that lady friend I seen you with that night?&rdquo;
she asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a lady friend,&rdquo; was his answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a long time ago,&rdquo; she murmured contemplatively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It seems like a thousand years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Martin went no further into the matter.&nbsp; He led the conversation
off into other channels.&nbsp; They had lunch in the restaurant, where
he ordered wine and expensive delicacies and afterward he danced with
her and with no one but her, till she was tired.&nbsp; He was a good
dancer, and she whirled around and around with him in a heaven of delight,
her head against his shoulder, wishing that it could last forever.&nbsp;
Later in the afternoon they strayed off among the trees, where, in the
good old fashion, she sat down while he sprawled on his back, his head
in her lap.&nbsp; He lay and dozed, while she fondled his hair, looked
down on his closed eyes, and loved him without reserve.&nbsp; Looking
up suddenly, he read the tender advertisement in her face.&nbsp; Her
eyes fluttered down, then they opened and looked into his with soft
defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept straight all these years,&rdquo; she said,
her voice so low that it was almost a whisper.</p>
<p>In his heart Martin knew that it was the miraculous truth.&nbsp;
And at his heart pleaded a great temptation.&nbsp; It was in his power
to make her happy.&nbsp; Denied happiness himself, why should he deny
happiness to her?&nbsp; He could marry her and take her down with him
to dwell in the grass-walled castle in the Marquesas.&nbsp; The desire
to do it was strong, but stronger still was the imperative command of
his nature not to do it.&nbsp; In spite of himself he was still faithful
to Love.&nbsp; The old days of license and easy living were gone.&nbsp;
He could not bring them back, nor could he go back to them.&nbsp; He
was changed&mdash;how changed he had not realized until now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a marrying man, Lizzie,&rdquo; he said lightly.</p>
<p>The hand caressing his hair paused perceptibly, then went on with
the same gentle stroke.&nbsp; He noticed her face harden, but it was
with the hardness of resolution, for still the soft color was in her
cheeks and she was all glowing and melting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not mean that&mdash;&rdquo; she began, then faltered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Or anyway I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
proud to be your friend.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d do anything for you.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m made that way, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin sat up.&nbsp; He took her hand in his.&nbsp; He did it deliberately,
with warmth but without passion; and such warmth chilled her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a great and noble woman,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
it is I who should be proud to know you.&nbsp; And I am, I am.&nbsp;
You are a ray of light to me in a very dark world, and I&rsquo;ve got
to be straight with you, just as straight as you have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether you&rsquo;re straight with me or
not.&nbsp; You could do anything with me.&nbsp; You could throw me in
the dirt an&rsquo; walk on me.&nbsp; An&rsquo; you&rsquo;re the only
man in the world that can,&rdquo; she added with a defiant flash.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t taken care of myself ever since I was a kid for
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s just because of that that I&rsquo;m not going
to,&rdquo; he said gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are so big and generous
that you challenge me to equal generousness.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not marrying,
and I&rsquo;m not&mdash;well, loving without marrying, though I&rsquo;ve
done my share of that in the past.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry I came here
to-day and met you.&nbsp; But it can&rsquo;t be helped now, and I never
expected it would turn out this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here, Lizzie.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t begin to tell you
how much I like you.&nbsp; I do more than like you.&nbsp; I admire and
respect you.&nbsp; You are magnificent, and you are magnificently good.&nbsp;
But what&rsquo;s the use of words?&nbsp; Yet there&rsquo;s something
I&rsquo;d like to do.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve had a hard life; let me make
it easy for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; (A joyous light welled into her eyes,
then faded out again.)&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure of getting
hold of some money soon&mdash;lots of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that moment he abandoned the idea of the valley and the bay, the
grass-walled castle and the trim, white schooner.&nbsp; After all, what
did it matter?&nbsp; He could go away, as he had done so often, before
the mast, on any ship bound anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to turn it over to you.&nbsp; There must be
something you want&mdash;to go to school or business college.&nbsp;
You might like to study and be a stenographer.&nbsp; I could fix it
for you.&nbsp; Or maybe your father and mother are living&mdash;I could
set them up in a grocery store or something.&nbsp; Anything you want,
just name it, and I can fix it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no reply, but sat, gazing straight before her, dry-eyed
and motionless, but with an ache in the throat which Martin divined
so strongly that it made his own throat ache.&nbsp; He regretted that
he had spoken.&nbsp; It seemed so tawdry what he had offered her&mdash;mere
money&mdash;compared with what she offered him.&nbsp; He offered her
an extraneous thing with which he could part without a pang, while she
offered him herself, along with disgrace and shame, and sin, and all
her hopes of heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it,&rdquo; she said with
a catch in her voice that she changed to a cough.&nbsp; She stood up.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go home.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m all tired out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day was done, and the merrymakers had nearly all departed.&nbsp;
But as Martin and Lizzie emerged from the trees they found the gang
waiting for them.&nbsp; Martin knew immediately the meaning of it.&nbsp;
Trouble was brewing.&nbsp; The gang was his body-guard.&nbsp; They passed
out through the gates of the park with, straggling in the rear, a second
gang, the friends that Lizzie&rsquo;s young man had collected to avenge
the loss of his lady.&nbsp; Several constables and special police officers,
anticipating trouble, trailed along to prevent it, and herded the two
gangs separately aboard the train for San Francisco.&nbsp; Martin told
Jimmy that he would get off at Sixteenth Street Station and catch the
electric car into Oakland.&nbsp; Lizzie was very quiet and without interest
in what was impending.&nbsp; The train pulled in to Sixteenth Street
Station, and the waiting electric car could be seen, the conductor of
which was impatiently clanging the gong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is,&rdquo; Jimmy counselled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Make a
run for it, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll hold &rsquo;em back.&nbsp; Now you
go!&nbsp; Hit her up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hostile gang was temporarily disconcerted by the manoeuvre, then
it dashed from the train in pursuit.&nbsp; The staid and sober Oakland
folk who sat upon the car scarcely noted the young fellow and the girl
who ran for it and found a seat in front on the outside.&nbsp; They
did not connect the couple with Jimmy, who sprang on the steps, crying
to the motorman:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slam on the juice, old man, and beat it outa here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment Jimmy whirled about, and the passengers saw him land
his fist on the face of a running man who was trying to board the car.&nbsp;
But fists were landing on faces the whole length of the car.&nbsp; Thus,
Jimmy and his gang, strung out on the long, lower steps, met the attacking
gang.&nbsp; The car started with a great clanging of its gong, and,
as Jimmy&rsquo;s gang drove off the last assailants, they, too, jumped
off to finish the job.&nbsp; The car dashed on, leaving the flurry of
combat far behind, and its dumfounded passengers never dreamed that
the quiet young man and the pretty working-girl sitting in the corner
on the outside seat had been the cause of the row.</p>
<p>Martin had enjoyed the fight, with a recrudescence of the old fighting
thrills.&nbsp; But they quickly died away, and he was oppressed by a
great sadness.&nbsp; He felt very old&mdash;centuries older than those
careless, care-free young companions of his others days.&nbsp; He had
travelled far, too far to go back.&nbsp; Their mode of life, which had
once been his, was now distasteful to him.&nbsp; He was disappointed
in it all.&nbsp; He had developed into an alien.&nbsp; As the steam
beer had tasted raw, so their companionship seemed raw to him.&nbsp;
He was too far removed.&nbsp; Too many thousands of opened books yawned
between them and him.&nbsp; He had exiled himself.&nbsp; He had travelled
in the vast realm of intellect until he could no longer return home.&nbsp;
On the other hand, he was human, and his gregarious need for companionship
remained unsatisfied.&nbsp; He had found no new home.&nbsp; As the gang
could not understand him, as his own family could not understand him,
as the bourgeoisie could not understand him, so this girl beside him,
whom he honored high, could not understand him nor the honor he paid
her.&nbsp; His sadness was not untouched with bitterness as he thought
it over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it up with him,&rdquo; he advised Lizzie, at parting,
as they stood in front of the workingman&rsquo;s shack in which she
lived, near Sixth and Market.&nbsp; He referred to the young fellow
whose place he had usurped that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;now,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go on,&rdquo; he said jovially.&nbsp; &ldquo;All you have
to do is whistle and he&rsquo;ll come running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>And he knew what she had meant.</p>
<p>She leaned toward him as he was about to say good night.&nbsp; But
she leaned not imperatively, not seductively, but wistfully and humbly.&nbsp;
He was touched to the heart.&nbsp; His large tolerance rose up in him.&nbsp;
He put his arms around her, and kissed her, and knew that upon his own
lips rested as true a kiss as man ever received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; she sobbed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could die for you.&nbsp;
I could die for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tore herself from him suddenly and ran up the steps.&nbsp; He
felt a quick moisture in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin Eden,&rdquo; he communed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not a brute, and you&rsquo;re a damn poor Nietzscheman.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d
marry her if you could and fill her quivering heart full with happiness.&nbsp;
But you can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s a damn shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A poor old tramp explains his poor old ulcers,&rsquo;&rdquo;
he muttered, remembering his Henly.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Life is, I think,
a blunder and a shame.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is&mdash;a blunder and a shame.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Shame of the Sun&rdquo; was published in October.&nbsp;
As Martin cut the cords of the express package and the half-dozen complimentary
copies from the publishers spilled out on the table, a heavy sadness
fell upon him.&nbsp; He thought of the wild delight that would have
been his had this happened a few short months before, and he contrasted
that delight that should have been with his present uncaring coldness.&nbsp;
His book, his first book, and his pulse had not gone up a fraction of
a beat, and he was only sad.&nbsp; It meant little to him now.&nbsp;
The most it meant was that it might bring some money, and little enough
did he care for money.</p>
<p>He carried a copy out into the kitchen and presented it to Maria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did it,&rdquo; he explained, in order to clear up her bewilderment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wrote it in the room there, and I guess some few quarts of
your vegetable soup went into the making of it.&nbsp; Keep it.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s yours.&nbsp; Just to remember me by, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not bragging, not showing off.&nbsp; His sole motive was to
make her happy, to make her proud of him, to justify her long faith
in him.&nbsp; She put the book in the front room on top of the family
Bible.&nbsp; A sacred thing was this book her lodger had made, a fetich
of friendship.&nbsp; It softened the blow of his having been a laundryman,
and though she could not understand a line of it, she knew that every
line of it was great.&nbsp; She was a simple, practical, hard-working
woman, but she possessed faith in large endowment.</p>
<p>Just as emotionlessly as he had received &ldquo;The Shame of the
Sun&rdquo; did he read the reviews of it that came in weekly from the
clipping bureau.&nbsp; The book was making a hit, that was evident.&nbsp;
It meant more gold in the money sack.&nbsp; He could fix up Lizzie,
redeem all his promises, and still have enough left to build his grass-walled
castle.</p>
<p>Singletree, Darnley &amp; Co. had cautiously brought out an edition
of fifteen hundred copies, but the first reviews had started a second
edition of twice the size through the presses; and ere this was delivered
a third edition of five thousand had been ordered.&nbsp; A London firm
made arrangements by cable for an English edition, and hot-footed upon
this came the news of French, German, and Scandinavian translations
in progress.&nbsp; The attack upon the Maeterlinck school could not
have been made at a more opportune moment.&nbsp; A fierce controversy
was precipitated.&nbsp; Saleeby and Haeckel indorsed and defended &ldquo;The
Shame of the Sun,&rdquo; for once finding themselves on the same side
of a question.&nbsp; Crookes and Wallace ranged up on the opposing side,
while Sir Oliver Lodge attempted to formulate a compromise that would
jibe with his particular cosmic theories.&nbsp; Maeterlinck&rsquo;s
followers rallied around the standard of mysticism.&nbsp; Chesterton
set the whole world laughing with a series of alleged non-partisan essays
on the subject, and the whole affair, controversy and controversialists,
was well-nigh swept into the pit by a thundering broadside from George
Bernard Shaw.&nbsp; Needless to say the arena was crowded with hosts
of lesser lights, and the dust and sweat and din became terrific.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a most marvellous happening,&rdquo; Singletree, Darnley
&amp; Co. wrote Martin, &ldquo;a critical philosophic essay selling
like a novel.&nbsp; You could not have chosen your subject better, and
all contributory factors have been unwarrantedly propitious.&nbsp; We
need scarcely to assure you that we are making hay while the sun shines.&nbsp;
Over forty thousand copies have already been sold in the United States
and Canada, and a new edition of twenty thousand is on the presses.&nbsp;
We are overworked, trying to supply the demand.&nbsp; Nevertheless we
have helped to create that demand.&nbsp; We have already spent five
thousand dollars in advertising.&nbsp; The book is bound to be a record-breaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please find herewith a contract in duplicate for your next
book which we have taken the liberty of forwarding to you.&nbsp; You
will please note that we have increased your royalties to twenty per
cent, which is about as high as a conservative publishing house dares
go.&nbsp; If our offer is agreeable to you, please fill in the proper
blank space with the title of your book.&nbsp; We make no stipulations
concerning its nature.&nbsp; Any book on any subject.&nbsp; If you have
one already written, so much the better.&nbsp; Now is the time to strike.&nbsp;
The iron could not be hotter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On receipt of signed contract we shall be pleased to make
you an advance on royalties of five thousand dollars.&nbsp; You see,
we have faith in you, and we are going in on this thing big.&nbsp; We
should like, also, to discuss with you the drawing up of a contract
for a term of years, say ten, during which we shall have the exclusive
right of publishing in book-form all that you produce.&nbsp; But more
of this anon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin laid down the letter and worked a problem in mental arithmetic,
finding the product of fifteen cents times sixty thousand to be nine
thousand dollars.&nbsp; He signed the new contract, inserting &ldquo;The
Smoke of Joy&rdquo; in the blank space, and mailed it back to the publishers
along with the twenty storiettes he had written in the days before he
discovered the formula for the newspaper storiette.&nbsp; And promptly
as the United States mail could deliver and return, came Singletree,
Darnley &amp; Co.&rsquo;s check for five thousand dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to come down town with me, Maria, this afternoon
about two o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Martin said, the morning the check arrived.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Or, better, meet me at Fourteenth and Broadway at two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll be looking out for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the appointed time she was there; but <i>shoes</i> was the only
clew to the mystery her mind had been capable of evolving, and she suffered
a distinct shock of disappointment when Martin walked her right by a
shoe-store and dived into a real estate office.&nbsp; What happened
thereupon resided forever after in her memory as a dream.&nbsp; Fine
gentlemen smiled at her benevolently as they talked with Martin and
one another; a type-writer clicked; signatures were affixed to an imposing
document; her own landlord was there, too, and affixed his signature;
and when all was over and she was outside on the sidewalk, her landlord
spoke to her, saying, &ldquo;Well, Maria, you won&rsquo;t have to pay
me no seven dollars and a half this month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria was too stunned for speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or next month, or the next, or the next,&rdquo; her landlord
said.</p>
<p>She thanked him incoherently, as if for a favor.&nbsp; And it was
not until she had returned home to North Oakland and conferred with
her own kind, and had the Portuguese grocer investigate, that she really
knew that she was the owner of the little house in which she had lived
and for which she had paid rent so long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you trade with me no more?&rdquo; the Portuguese
grocer asked Martin that evening, stepping out to hail him when he got
off the car; and Martin explained that he wasn&rsquo;t doing his own
cooking any more, and then went in and had a drink of wine on the house.&nbsp;
He noted it was the best wine the grocer had in stock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; Martin announced that night, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to leave you.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;re going to leave here yourself
soon.&nbsp; Then you can rent the house and be a landlord yourself.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve a brother in San Leandro or Haywards, and he&rsquo;s in
the milk business.&nbsp; I want you to send all your washing back unwashed&mdash;understand?&mdash;unwashed,
and to go out to San Leandro to-morrow, or Haywards, or wherever it
is, and see that brother of yours.&nbsp; Tell him to come to see me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll be stopping at the Metropole down in Oakland.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
know a good milk-ranch when he sees one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was that Maria became a landlord and the sole owner of
a dairy, with two hired men to do the work for her and a bank account
that steadily increased despite the fact that her whole brood wore shoes
and went to school.&nbsp; Few persons ever meet the fairy princes they
dream about; but Maria, who worked hard and whose head was hard, never
dreaming about fairy princes, entertained hers in the guise of an ex-laundryman.</p>
<p>In the meantime the world had begun to ask: &ldquo;Who is this Martin
Eden?&rdquo;&nbsp; He had declined to give any biographical data to
his publishers, but the newspapers were not to be denied.&nbsp; Oakland
was his own town, and the reporters nosed out scores of individuals
who could supply information.&nbsp; All that he was and was not, all
that he had done and most of what he had not done, was spread out for
the delectation of the public, accompanied by snapshots and photographs&mdash;the
latter procured from the local photographer who had once taken Martin&rsquo;s
picture and who promptly copyrighted it and put it on the market.&nbsp;
At first, so great was his disgust with the magazines and all bourgeois
society, Martin fought against publicity; but in the end, because it
was easier than not to, he surrendered.&nbsp; He found that he could
not refuse himself to the special writers who travelled long distances
to see him.&nbsp; Then again, each day was so many hours long, and,
since he no longer was occupied with writing and studying, those hours
had to be occupied somehow; so he yielded to what was to him a whim,
permitted interviews, gave his opinions on literature and philosophy,
and even accepted invitations of the bourgeoisie.&nbsp; He had settled
down into a strange and comfortable state of mind.&nbsp; He no longer
cared.&nbsp; He forgave everybody, even the cub reporter who had painted
him red and to whom he now granted a full page with specially posed
photographs.</p>
<p>He saw Lizzie occasionally, and it was patent that she regretted
the greatness that had come to him.&nbsp; It widened the space between
them.&nbsp; Perhaps it was with the hope of narrowing it that she yielded
to his persuasions to go to night school and business college and to
have herself gowned by a wonderful dressmaker who charged outrageous
prices.&nbsp; She improved visibly from day to day, until Martin wondered
if he was doing right, for he knew that all her compliance and endeavor
was for his sake.&nbsp; She was trying to make herself of worth in his
eyes&mdash;of the sort of worth he seemed to value.&nbsp; Yet he gave
her no hope, treating her in brotherly fashion and rarely seeing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overdue&rdquo; was rushed upon the market by the Meredith-Lowell
Company in the height of his popularity, and being fiction, in point
of sales it made even a bigger strike than &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Week after week his was the credit of the unprecedented performance
of having two books at the head of the list of best-sellers.&nbsp; Not
only did the story take with the fiction-readers, but those who read
&ldquo;The Shame of the Sun&rdquo; with avidity were likewise attracted
to the sea-story by the cosmic grasp of mastery with which he had handled
it.&nbsp; First he had attacked the literature of mysticism, and had
done it exceeding well; and, next, he had successfully supplied the
very literature he had exposited, thus proving himself to be that rare
genius, a critic and a creator in one.</p>
<p>Money poured in on him, fame poured in on him; he flashed, comet-like,
through the world of literature, and he was more amused than interested
by the stir he was making.&nbsp; One thing was puzzling him, a little
thing that would have puzzled the world had it known.&nbsp; But the
world would have puzzled over his bepuzzlement rather than over the
little thing that to him loomed gigantic.&nbsp; Judge Blount invited
him to dinner.&nbsp; That was the little thing, or the beginning of
the little thing, that was soon to become the big thing.&nbsp; He had
insulted Judge Blount, treated him abominably, and Judge Blount, meeting
him on the street, invited him to dinner.&nbsp; Martin bethought himself
of the numerous occasions on which he had met Judge Blount at the Morses&rsquo;
and when Judge Blount had not invited him to dinner.&nbsp; Why had he
not invited him to dinner then? he asked himself.&nbsp; He had not changed.&nbsp;
He was the same Martin Eden.&nbsp; What made the difference?&nbsp; The
fact that the stuff he had written had appeared inside the covers of
books?&nbsp; But it was work performed.&nbsp; It was not something he
had done since.&nbsp; It was achievement accomplished at the very time
Judge Blount was sharing this general view and sneering at his Spencer
and his intellect.&nbsp; Therefore it was not for any real value, but
for a purely fictitious value that Judge Blount invited him to dinner.</p>
<p>Martin grinned and accepted the invitation, marvelling the while
at his complacence.&nbsp; And at the dinner, where, with their womankind,
were half a dozen of those that sat in high places, and where Martin
found himself quite the lion, Judge Blount, warmly seconded by Judge
Hanwell, urged privately that Martin should permit his name to be put
up for the Styx&mdash;the ultra-select club to which belonged, not the
mere men of wealth, but the men of attainment.&nbsp; And Martin declined,
and was more puzzled than ever.</p>
<p>He was kept busy disposing of his heap of manuscripts.&nbsp; He was
overwhelmed by requests from editors.&nbsp; It had been discovered that
he was a stylist, with meat under his style.&nbsp; <i>The Northern Review</i>,
after publishing &ldquo;The Cradle of Beauty,&rdquo; had written him
for half a dozen similar essays, which would have been supplied out
of the heap, had not <i>Burton&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, in a speculative
mood, offered him five hundred dollars each for five essays.&nbsp; He
wrote back that he would supply the demand, but at a thousand dollars
an essay.&nbsp; He remembered that all these manuscripts had been refused
by the very magazines that were now clamoring for them.&nbsp; And their
refusals had been cold-blooded, automatic, stereotyped.&nbsp; They had
made him sweat, and now he intended to make them sweat.&nbsp; <i>Burton&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> paid his price for five essays, and the remaining four,
at the same rate, were snapped up by <i>Mackintosh&rsquo;s Monthly,
The Northern Review</i> being too poor to stand the pace.&nbsp; Thus
went out to the world &ldquo;The High Priests of Mystery,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Wonder-Dreamers,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Yardstick of the Ego,&rdquo; &ldquo;Philosophy
of Illusion,&rdquo; &ldquo;God and Clod,&rdquo; &ldquo;Art and Biology,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Critics and Test-tubes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Star-dust,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Dignity of Usury,&rdquo;&mdash;to raise storms and rumblings and mutterings
that were many a day in dying down.</p>
<p>Editors wrote to him telling him to name his own terms, which he
did, but it was always for work performed.&nbsp; He refused resolutely
to pledge himself to any new thing.&nbsp; The thought of again setting
pen to paper maddened him.&nbsp; He had seen Brissenden torn to pieces
by the crowd, and despite the fact that him the crowd acclaimed, he
could not get over the shock nor gather any respect for the crowd.&nbsp;
His very popularity seemed a disgrace and a treason to Brissenden.&nbsp;
It made him wince, but he made up his mind to go on and fill the money-bag.</p>
<p>He received letters from editors like the following: &ldquo;About
a year ago we were unfortunate enough to refuse your collection of love-poems.&nbsp;
We were greatly impressed by them at the time, but certain arrangements
already entered into prevented our taking them.&nbsp; If you still have
them, and if you will be kind enough to forward them, we shall be glad
to publish the entire collection on your own terms.&nbsp; We are also
prepared to make a most advantageous offer for bringing them out in
book-form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin recollected his blank-verse tragedy, and sent it instead.&nbsp;
He read it over before mailing, and was particularly impressed by its
sophomoric amateurishness and general worthlessness.&nbsp; But he sent
it; and it was published, to the everlasting regret of the editor.&nbsp;
The public was indignant and incredulous.&nbsp; It was too far a cry
from Martin Eden&rsquo;s high standard to that serious bosh.&nbsp; It
was asserted that he had never written it, that the magazine had faked
it very clumsily, or that Martin Eden was emulating the elder Dumas
and at the height of success was hiring his writing done for him.&nbsp;
But when he explained that the tragedy was an early effort of his literary
childhood, and that the magazine had refused to be happy unless it got
it, a great laugh went up at the magazine&rsquo;s expense and a change
in the editorship followed.&nbsp; The tragedy was never brought out
in book-form, though Martin pocketed the advance royalties that had
been paid.</p>
<p><i>Coleman&rsquo;s Weekly</i> sent Martin a lengthy telegram, costing
nearly three hundred dollars, offering him a thousand dollars an article
for twenty articles.&nbsp; He was to travel over the United States,
with all expenses paid, and select whatever topics interested him.&nbsp;
The body of the telegram was devoted to hypothetical topics in order
to show him the freedom of range that was to be his.&nbsp; The only
restriction placed upon him was that he must confine himself to the
United States.&nbsp; Martin sent his inability to accept and his regrets
by wire &ldquo;collect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wiki-Wiki,&rdquo; published in <i>Warren&rsquo;s Monthly</i>,
was an instantaneous success.&nbsp; It was brought out forward in a
wide-margined, beautifully decorated volume that struck the holiday
trade and sold like wildfire.&nbsp; The critics were unanimous in the
belief that it would take its place with those two classics by two great
writers, &ldquo;The Bottle Imp&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Magic Skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The public, however, received the &ldquo;Smoke of Joy&rdquo; collection
rather dubiously and coldly.&nbsp; The audacity and unconventionality
of the storiettes was a shock to bourgeois morality and prejudice; but
when Paris went mad over the immediate translation that was made, the
American and English reading public followed suit and bought so many
copies that Martin compelled the conservative house of Singletree, Darnley
&amp; Co. to pay a flat royalty of twenty-five per cent for a third
book, and thirty per cent flat for a fourth.&nbsp; These two volumes
comprised all the short stories he had written and which had received,
or were receiving, serial publication.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Ring of Bells&rdquo;
and his horror stories constituted one collection; the other collection
was composed of &ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pot,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Wine of Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Whirlpool,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Jostling
Street,&rdquo; and four other stories.&nbsp; The Lowell-Meredith Company
captured the collection of all his essays, and the Maxmillian Company
got his &ldquo;Sea Lyrics&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Love-cycle,&rdquo; the
latter receiving serial publication in the <i>Ladies&rsquo; Home Companion</i>
after the payment of an extortionate price.</p>
<p>Martin heaved a sigh of relief when he had disposed of the last manuscript.&nbsp;
The grass-walled castle and the white, coppered schooner were very near
to him.&nbsp; Well, at any rate he had discovered Brissenden&rsquo;s
contention that nothing of merit found its way into the magazines.&nbsp;
His own success demonstrated that Brissenden had been wrong.</p>
<p>And yet, somehow, he had a feeling that Brissenden had been right,
after all.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun&rdquo; had been the cause
of his success more than the stuff he had written.&nbsp; That stuff
had been merely incidental.&nbsp; It had been rejected right and left
by the magazines.&nbsp; The publication of &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun&rdquo;
had started a controversy and precipitated the landslide in his favor.&nbsp;
Had there been no &ldquo;Shame of the Sun&rdquo; there would have been
no landslide, and had there been no miracle in the go of &ldquo;The
Shame of the Sun&rdquo; there would have been no landslide.&nbsp; Singletree,
Darnley &amp; Co. attested that miracle.&nbsp; They had brought out
a first edition of fifteen hundred copies and been dubious of selling
it.&nbsp; They were experienced publishers and no one had been more
astounded than they at the success which had followed.&nbsp; To them
it had been in truth a miracle.&nbsp; They never got over it, and every
letter they wrote him reflected their reverent awe of that first mysterious
happening.&nbsp; They did not attempt to explain it.&nbsp; There was
no explaining it.&nbsp; It had happened.&nbsp; In the face of all experience
to the contrary, it had happened.</p>
<p>So it was, reasoning thus, that Martin questioned the validity of
his popularity.&nbsp; It was the bourgeoisie that bought his books and
poured its gold into his money-sack, and from what little he knew of
the bourgeoisie it was not clear to him how it could possibly appreciate
or comprehend what he had written.&nbsp; His intrinsic beauty and power
meant nothing to the hundreds of thousands who were acclaiming him and
buying his books.&nbsp; He was the fad of the hour, the adventurer who
had stormed Parnassus while the gods nodded.&nbsp; The hundreds of thousands
read him and acclaimed him with the same brute non-understanding with
which they had flung themselves on Brissenden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo;
and torn it to pieces&mdash;a wolf-rabble that fawned on him instead
of fanging him.&nbsp; Fawn or fang, it was all a matter of chance.&nbsp;
One thing he knew with absolute certitude: &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; was
infinitely greater than anything he had done.&nbsp; It was infinitely
greater than anything he had in him.&nbsp; It was a poem of centuries.&nbsp;
Then the tribute the mob paid him was a sorry tribute indeed, for that
same mob had wallowed &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; into the mire.&nbsp; He
sighed heavily and with satisfaction.&nbsp; He was glad the last manuscript
was sold and that he would soon be done with it all.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIV</h2>
<p>Mr. Morse met Martin in the office of the Hotel Metropole.&nbsp;
Whether he had happened there just casually, intent on other affairs,
or whether he had come there for the direct purpose of inviting him
to dinner, Martin never could quite make up his mind, though he inclined
toward the second hypothesis.&nbsp; At any rate, invited to dinner he
was by Mr. Morse&mdash;Ruth&rsquo;s father, who had forbidden him the
house and broken off the engagement.</p>
<p>Martin was not angry.&nbsp; He was not even on his dignity.&nbsp;
He tolerated Mr. Morse, wondering the while how it felt to eat such
humble pie.&nbsp; He did not decline the invitation.&nbsp; Instead,
he put it off with vagueness and indefiniteness and inquired after the
family, particularly after Mrs. Morse and Ruth.&nbsp; He spoke her name
without hesitancy, naturally, though secretly surprised that he had
had no inward quiver, no old, familiar increase of pulse and warm surge
of blood.</p>
<p>He had many invitations to dinner, some of which he accepted.&nbsp;
Persons got themselves introduced to him in order to invite him to dinner.&nbsp;
And he went on puzzling over the little thing that was becoming a great
thing.&nbsp; Bernard Higginbotham invited him to dinner.&nbsp; He puzzled
the harder.&nbsp; He remembered the days of his desperate starvation
when no one invited him to dinner.&nbsp; That was the time he needed
dinners, and went weak and faint for lack of them and lost weight from
sheer famine.&nbsp; That was the paradox of it.&nbsp; When he wanted
dinners, no one gave them to him, and now that he could buy a hundred
thousand dinners and was losing his appetite, dinners were thrust upon
him right and left.&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; There was no justice in it,
no merit on his part.&nbsp; He was no different.&nbsp; All the work
he had done was even at that time work performed.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs.
Morse had condemned him for an idler and a shirk and through Ruth had
urged that he take a clerk&rsquo;s position in an office.&nbsp; Furthermore,
they had been aware of his work performed.&nbsp; Manuscript after manuscript
of his had been turned over to them by Ruth.&nbsp; They had read them.&nbsp;
It was the very same work that had put his name in all the papers, and,
it was his name being in all the papers that led them to invite him.</p>
<p>One thing was certain: the Morses had not cared to have him for himself
or for his work.&nbsp; Therefore they could not want him now for himself
or for his work, but for the fame that was his, because he was somebody
amongst men, and&mdash;why not?&mdash;because he had a hundred thousand
dollars or so.&nbsp; That was the way bourgeois society valued a man,
and who was he to expect it otherwise?&nbsp; But he was proud.&nbsp;
He disdained such valuation.&nbsp; He desired to be valued for himself,
or for his work, which, after all, was an expression of himself.&nbsp;
That was the way Lizzie valued him.&nbsp; The work, with her, did not
even count.&nbsp; She valued him, himself.&nbsp; That was the way Jimmy,
the plumber, and all the old gang valued him.&nbsp; That had been proved
often enough in the days when he ran with them; it had been proved that
Sunday at Shell Mound Park.&nbsp; His work could go hang.&nbsp; What
they liked, and were willing to scrap for, was just Mart Eden, one of
the bunch and a pretty good guy.</p>
<p>Then there was Ruth.&nbsp; She had liked him for himself, that was
indisputable.&nbsp; And yet, much as she had liked him she had liked
the bourgeois standard of valuation more.&nbsp; She had opposed his
writing, and principally, it seemed to him, because it did not earn
money.&nbsp; That had been her criticism of his &ldquo;Love-cycle.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She, too, had urged him to get a job.&nbsp; It was true, she refined
it to &ldquo;position,&rdquo; but it meant the same thing, and in his
own mind the old nomenclature stuck.&nbsp; He had read her all that
he wrote&mdash;poems, stories, essays&mdash;&ldquo;Wiki-Wiki,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Shame of the Sun,&rdquo; everything.&nbsp; And she had always
and consistently urged him to get a job, to go to work&mdash;good God!&mdash;as
if he hadn&rsquo;t been working, robbing sleep, exhausting life, in
order to be worthy of her.</p>
<p>So the little thing grew bigger.&nbsp; He was healthy and normal,
ate regularly, slept long hours, and yet the growing little thing was
becoming an obsession.&nbsp; <i>Work performed</i>.&nbsp; The phrase
haunted his brain.&nbsp; He sat opposite Bernard Higginbotham at a heavy
Sunday dinner over Higginbotham&rsquo;s Cash Store, and it was all he
could do to restrain himself from shouting out:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was work performed!&nbsp; And now you feed me, when then
you let me starve, forbade me your house, and damned me because I wouldn&rsquo;t
get a job.&nbsp; And the work was already done, all done.&nbsp; And
now, when I speak, you check the thought unuttered on your lips and
hang on my lips and pay respectful attention to whatever I choose to
say.&nbsp; I tell you your party is rotten and filled with grafters,
and instead of flying into a rage you hum and haw and admit there is
a great deal in what I say.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Because I&rsquo;m famous;
because I&rsquo;ve a lot of money.&nbsp; Not because I&rsquo;m Martin
Eden, a pretty good fellow and not particularly a fool.&nbsp; I could
tell you the moon is made of green cheese and you would subscribe to
the notion, at least you would not repudiate it, because I&rsquo;ve
got dollars, mountains of them.&nbsp; And it was all done long ago;
it was work performed, I tell you, when you spat upon me as the dirt
under your feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Martin did not shout out.&nbsp; The thought gnawed in his brain,
an unceasing torment, while he smiled and succeeded in being tolerant.&nbsp;
As he grew silent, Bernard Higginbotham got the reins and did the talking.&nbsp;
He was a success himself, and proud of it.&nbsp; He was self-made.&nbsp;
No one had helped him.&nbsp; He owed no man.&nbsp; He was fulfilling
his duty as a citizen and bringing up a large family.&nbsp; And there
was Higginbotham&rsquo;s Cash Store, that monument of his own industry
and ability.&nbsp; He loved Higginbotham&rsquo;s Cash Store as some
men loved their wives.&nbsp; He opened up his heart to Martin, showed
with what keenness and with what enormous planning he had made the store.&nbsp;
And he had plans for it, ambitious plans.&nbsp; The neighborhood was
growing up fast.&nbsp; The store was really too small.&nbsp; If he had
more room, he would be able to put in a score of labor-saving and money-saving
improvements.&nbsp; And he would do it yet.&nbsp; He was straining every
effort for the day when he could buy the adjoining lot and put up another
two-story frame building.&nbsp; The upstairs he could rent, and the
whole ground-floor of both buildings would be Higginbotham&rsquo;s Cash
Store.&nbsp; His eyes glistened when he spoke of the new sign that would
stretch clear across both buildings.</p>
<p>Martin forgot to listen.&nbsp; The refrain of &ldquo;Work performed,&rdquo;
in his own brain, was drowning the other&rsquo;s clatter.&nbsp; The
refrain maddened him, and he tried to escape from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did you say it would cost?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>His brother-in-law paused in the middle of an expatiation on the
business opportunities of the neighborhood.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t said
how much it would cost.&nbsp; But he knew.&nbsp; He had figured it out
a score of times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the way lumber is now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;four thousand
could do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Including the sign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t count on that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;d just have to
come, onc&rsquo;t the buildin&rsquo; was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three thousand more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned forward, licking his lips, nervously spreading and closing
his fingers, while he watched Martin write a check.&nbsp; When it was
passed over to him, he glanced at the amount-seven thousand dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t afford to pay more than six per cent,&rdquo;
he said huskily.</p>
<p>Martin wanted to laugh, but, instead, demanded:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much would that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lemme see.&nbsp; Six per cent&mdash;six times seven&mdash;four
hundred an&rsquo; twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be thirty-five dollars a month, wouldn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higginbotham nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if you&rsquo;ve no objection, well arrange it this way.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Martin glanced at Gertrude.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can have the principal
to keep for yourself, if you&rsquo;ll use the thirty-five dollars a
month for cooking and washing and scrubbing.&nbsp; The seven thousand
is yours if you&rsquo;ll guarantee that Gertrude does no more drudgery.&nbsp;
Is it a go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Higginbotham swallowed hard.&nbsp; That his wife should do no
more housework was an affront to his thrifty soul.&nbsp; The magnificent
present was the coating of a pill, a bitter pill.&nbsp; That his wife
should not work!&nbsp; It gagged him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; Martin said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
pay the thirty-five a month, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached across the table for the check.&nbsp; But Bernard Higginbotham
got his hand on it first, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accept!&nbsp; I accept!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Martin got on the electric car, he was very sick and tired.&nbsp;
He looked up at the assertive sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The swine,&rdquo; he groaned.&nbsp; &ldquo;The swine, the
swine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When <i>Mackintosh&rsquo;s Magazine</i> published &ldquo;The Palmist,&rdquo;
featuring it with decorations by Berthier and with two pictures by Wenn,
Hermann von Schmidt forgot that he had called the verses obscene.&nbsp;
He announced that his wife had inspired the poem, saw to it that the
news reached the ears of a reporter, and submitted to an interview by
a staff writer who was accompanied by a staff photographer and a staff
artist.&nbsp; The result was a full page in a Sunday supplement, filled
with photographs and idealized drawings of Marian, with many intimate
details of Martin Eden and his family, and with the full text of &ldquo;The
Palmist&rdquo; in large type, and republished by special permission
of <i>Mackintosh&rsquo;s Magazine</i>.&nbsp; It caused quite a stir
in the neighborhood, and good housewives were proud to have the acquaintances
of the great writer&rsquo;s sister, while those who had not made haste
to cultivate it.&nbsp; Hermann von Schmidt chuckled in his little repair
shop and decided to order a new lathe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Better than advertising,&rdquo;
he told Marian, &ldquo;and it costs nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better have him to dinner,&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
<p>And to dinner Martin came, making himself agreeable with the fat
wholesale butcher and his fatter wife&mdash;important folk, they, likely
to be of use to a rising young man like Hermann Von Schmidt.&nbsp; No
less a bait, however, had been required to draw them to his house than
his great brother-in-law.&nbsp; Another man at table who had swallowed
the same bait was the superintendent of the Pacific Coast agencies for
the Asa Bicycle Company.&nbsp; Him Von Schmidt desired to please and
propitiate because from him could be obtained the Oakland agency for
the bicycle.&nbsp; So Hermann von Schmidt found it a goodly asset to
have Martin for a brother-in-law, but in his heart of hearts he couldn&rsquo;t
understand where it all came in.&nbsp; In the silent watches of the
night, while his wife slept, he had floundered through Martin&rsquo;s
books and poems, and decided that the world was a fool to buy them.</p>
<p>And in his heart of hearts Martin understood the situation only too
well, as he leaned back and gloated at Von Schmidt&rsquo;s head, in
fancy punching it well-nigh off of him, sending blow after blow home
just right&mdash;the chuckle-headed Dutchman!&nbsp; One thing he did
like about him, however.&nbsp; Poor as he was, and determined to rise
as he was, he nevertheless hired one servant to take the heavy work
off of Marian&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; Martin talked with the superintendent
of the Asa agencies, and after dinner he drew him aside with Hermann,
whom he backed financially for the best bicycle store with fittings
in Oakland.&nbsp; He went further, and in a private talk with Hermann
told him to keep his eyes open for an automobile agency and garage,
for there was no reason that he should not be able to run both establishments
successfully.</p>
<p>With tears in her eyes and her arms around his neck, Marian, at parting,
told Martin how much she loved him and always had loved him.&nbsp; It
was true, there was a perceptible halt midway in her assertion, which
she glossed over with more tears and kisses and incoherent stammerings,
and which Martin inferred to be her appeal for forgiveness for the time
she had lacked faith in him and insisted on his getting a job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t never keep his money, that&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo;
Hermann von Schmidt confided to his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;He got mad when
I spoke of interest, an&rsquo; he said damn the principal and if I mentioned
it again, he&rsquo;d punch my Dutch head off.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what
he said&mdash;my Dutch head.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s all right, even if
he ain&rsquo;t no business man.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s given me my chance,
an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Invitations to dinner poured in on Martin; and the more they poured,
the more he puzzled.&nbsp; He sat, the guest of honor, at an Arden Club
banquet, with men of note whom he had heard about and read about all
his life; and they told him how, when they had read &ldquo;The Ring
of Bells&rdquo; in the <i>Transcontinental</i>, and &ldquo;The Peri
and the Pearl&rdquo; in <i>The Hornet</i>, they had immediately picked
him for a winner.&nbsp; My God! and I was hungry and in rags, he thought
to himself.&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you give me a dinner then?&nbsp;
Then was the time.&nbsp; It was work performed.&nbsp; If you are feeding
me now for work performed, why did you not feed me then when I needed
it?&nbsp; Not one word in &ldquo;The Ring of Bells,&rdquo; nor in &ldquo;The
Peri and the Pearl&rdquo; has been changed.&nbsp; No; you&rsquo;re not
feeding me now for work performed.&nbsp; You are feeding me because
everybody else is feeding me and because it is an honor to feed me.&nbsp;
You are feeding me now because you are herd animals; because you are
part of the mob; because the one blind, automatic thought in the mob-mind
just now is to feed me.&nbsp; And where does Martin Eden and the work
Martin Eden performed come in in all this? he asked himself plaintively,
then arose to respond cleverly and wittily to a clever and witty toast.</p>
<p>So it went.&nbsp; Wherever he happened to be&mdash;at the Press Club,
at the Redwood Club, at pink teas and literary gatherings&mdash;always
were remembered &ldquo;The Ring of Bells&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Peri
and the Pearl&rdquo; when they were first published.&nbsp; And always
was Martin&rsquo;s maddening and unuttered demand: Why didn&rsquo;t
you feed me then?&nbsp; It was work performed.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Ring
of Bells&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl&rdquo; are not changed
one iota.&nbsp; They were just as artistic, just as worth while, then
as now.&nbsp; But you are not feeding me for their sake, nor for the
sake of anything else I have written.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re feeding me
because it is the style of feeding just now, because the whole mob is
crazy with the idea of feeding Martin Eden.</p>
<p>And often, at such times, he would abruptly see slouch in among the
company a young hoodlum in square-cut coat and under a stiff-rim Stetson
hat.&nbsp; It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one
afternoon.&nbsp; As he rose from his chair and stepped forward across
the platform, he saw stalk through the wide door at the rear of the
great room the young hoodlum with the square-cut coat and stiff-rim
hat.&nbsp; Five hundred fashionably gowned women turned their heads,
so intent and steadfast was Martin&rsquo;s gaze, to see what he was
seeing.&nbsp; But they saw only the empty centre aisle.&nbsp; He saw
the young tough lurching down that aisle and wondered if he would remove
the stiff-rim which never yet had he seen him without.&nbsp; Straight
down the aisle he came, and up the platform.&nbsp; Martin could have
wept over that youthful shade of himself, when he thought of all that
lay before him.&nbsp; Across the platform he swaggered, right up to
Martin, and into the foreground of Martin&rsquo;s consciousness disappeared.&nbsp;
The five hundred women applauded softly with gloved hands, seeking to
encourage the bashful great man who was their guest.&nbsp; And Martin
shook the vision from his brain, smiled, and began to speak.</p>
<p>The Superintendent of Schools, good old man, stopped Martin on the
street and remembered him, recalling seances in his office when Martin
was expelled from school for fighting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read your &lsquo;Ring of Bells&rsquo; in one of the magazines
quite a time ago,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was as good as Poe.&nbsp;
Splendid, I said at the time, splendid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, and twice in the months that followed you passed me on the street
and did not know me, Martin almost said aloud.&nbsp; Each time I was
hungry and heading for the pawnbroker.&nbsp; Yet it was work performed.&nbsp;
You did not know me then.&nbsp; Why do you know me now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was remarking to my wife only the other day,&rdquo; the
other was saying, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea to have you
out to dinner some time?&nbsp; And she quite agreed with me.&nbsp; Yes,
she quite agreed with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner?&rdquo; Martin said so sharply that it was almost a
snarl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, yes, dinner, you know&mdash;just pot luck with us,
with your old superintendent, you rascal,&rdquo; he uttered nervously,
poking Martin in an attempt at jocular fellowship.</p>
<p>Martin went down the street in a daze.&nbsp; He stopped at the corner
and looked about him vacantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be damned!&rdquo; he murmured at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The old fellow was afraid of me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLV</h2>
<p>Kreis came to Martin one day&mdash;Kreis, of the &ldquo;real dirt&rdquo;;
and Martin turned to him with relief, to receive the glowing details
of a scheme sufficiently wild-catty to interest him as a fictionist
rather than an investor.&nbsp; Kreis paused long enough in the midst
of his exposition to tell him that in most of his &ldquo;Shame of the
Sun&rdquo; he had been a chump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t come here to spout philosophy,&rdquo; Kreis
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I want to know is whether or not you will
put a thousand dollars in on this deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not chump enough for that, at any rate,&rdquo;
Martin answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I will do.&nbsp;
You gave me the greatest night of my life.&nbsp; You gave me what money
cannot buy.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ve got money, and it means nothing to
me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to turn over to you a thousand dollars of what
I don&rsquo;t value for what you gave me that night and which was beyond
price.&nbsp; You need the money.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got more than I need.&nbsp;
You want it.&nbsp; You came for it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no use scheming
it out of me.&nbsp; Take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kreis betrayed no surprise.&nbsp; He folded the check away in his
pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that rate I&rsquo;d like the contract of providing you
with many such nights,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late.&rdquo;&nbsp; Martin shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
night was the one night for me.&nbsp; I was in paradise.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
commonplace with you, I know.&nbsp; But it wasn&rsquo;t to me.&nbsp;
I shall never live at such a pitch again.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m done with
philosophy.&nbsp; I want never to hear another word of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first dollar I ever made in my life out of my philosophy,&rdquo;
Kreis remarked, as he paused in the doorway.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then the
market broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morse drove by Martin on the street one day, and smiled and
nodded.&nbsp; He smiled back and lifted his hat.&nbsp; The episode did
not affect him.&nbsp; A month before it might have disgusted him, or
made him curious and set him to speculating about her state of consciousness
at that moment.&nbsp; But now it was not provocative of a second thought.&nbsp;
He forgot about it the next moment.&nbsp; He forgot about it as he would
have forgotten the Central Bank Building or the City Hall after having
walked past them.&nbsp; Yet his mind was preternaturally active.&nbsp;
His thoughts went ever around and around in a circle.&nbsp; The centre
of that circle was &ldquo;work performed&rdquo;; it ate at his brain
like a deathless maggot.&nbsp; He awoke to it in the morning.&nbsp;
It tormented his dreams at night.&nbsp; Every affair of life around
him that penetrated through his senses immediately related itself to
&ldquo;work performed.&rdquo;&nbsp; He drove along the path of relentless
logic to the conclusion that he was nobody, nothing.&nbsp; Mart Eden,
the hoodlum, and Mart Eden, the sailor, had been real, had been he;
but Martin Eden! the famous writer, did not exist.&nbsp; Martin Eden,
the famous writer, was a vapor that had arisen in the mob-mind and by
the mob-mind had been thrust into the corporeal being of Mart Eden,
the hoodlum and sailor.&nbsp; But it couldn&rsquo;t fool him.&nbsp;
He was not that sun-myth that the mob was worshipping and sacrificing
dinners to.&nbsp; He knew better.</p>
<p>He read the magazines about himself, and pored over portraits of
himself published therein until he was unable to associate his identity
with those portraits.&nbsp; He was the fellow who had lived and thrilled
and loved; who had been easy-going and tolerant of the frailties of
life; who had served in the forecastle, wandered in strange lands, and
led his gang in the old fighting days.&nbsp; He was the fellow who had
been stunned at first by the thousands of books in the free library,
and who had afterward learned his way among them and mastered them;
he was the fellow who had burned the midnight oil and bedded with a
spur and written books himself.&nbsp; But the one thing he was not was
that colossal appetite that all the mob was bent upon feeding.</p>
<p>There were things, however, in the magazines that amused him.&nbsp;
All the magazines were claiming him.&nbsp; <i>Warren&rsquo;s Monthly</i>
advertised to its subscribers that it was always on the quest after
new writers, and that, among others, it had introduced Martin Eden to
the reading public.&nbsp; <i>The White Mouse</i> claimed him; so did
<i>The Northern Review</i> and <i>Mackintosh&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, until
silenced by <i>The Globe</i>, which pointed triumphantly to its files
where the mangled &ldquo;Sea Lyrics&rdquo; lay buried.&nbsp; <i>Youth
and Age</i>, which had come to life again after having escaped paying
its bills, put in a prior claim, which nobody but farmers&rsquo; children
ever read.&nbsp; The <i>Transcontinental</i> made a dignified and convincing
statement of how it first discovered Martin Eden, which was warmly disputed
by <i>The Hornet</i>, with the exhibit of &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The modest claim of Singletree, Darnley &amp; Co. was lost in the din.&nbsp;
Besides, that publishing firm did not own a magazine wherewith to make
its claim less modest.</p>
<p>The newspapers calculated Martin&rsquo;s royalties.&nbsp; In some
way the magnificent offers certain magazines had made him leaked out,
and Oakland ministers called upon him in a friendly way, while professional
begging letters began to clutter his mail.&nbsp; But worse than all
this were the women.&nbsp; His photographs were published broadcast,
and special writers exploited his strong, bronzed face, his scars, his
heavy shoulders, his clear, quiet eyes, and the slight hollows in his
cheeks like an ascetic&rsquo;s.&nbsp; At this last he remembered his
wild youth and smiled.&nbsp; Often, among the women he met, he would
see now one, now another, looking at him, appraising him, selecting
him.&nbsp; He laughed to himself.&nbsp; He remembered Brissenden&rsquo;s
warning and laughed again.&nbsp; The women would never destroy him,
that much was certain.&nbsp; He had gone past that stage.</p>
<p>Once, walking with Lizzie toward night school, she caught a glance
directed toward him by a well-gowned, handsome woman of the bourgeoisie.&nbsp;
The glance was a trifle too long, a shade too considerative.&nbsp; Lizzie
knew it for what it was, and her body tensed angrily.&nbsp; Martin noticed,
noticed the cause of it, told her how used he was becoming to it and
that he did not care anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to care,&rdquo; she answered with blazing eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sick.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never healthier in my life.&nbsp; I weigh five pounds more
than I ever did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t your body.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s your head.&nbsp;
Something&rsquo;s wrong with your think-machine.&nbsp; Even I can see
that, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked on beside her, reflecting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give anything to see you get over it,&rdquo; she
broke out impulsively.&nbsp; &ldquo;You ought to care when women look
at you that way, a man like you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not natural.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s all right enough for sissy-boys.&nbsp; But you ain&rsquo;t
made that way.&nbsp; So help me, I&rsquo;d be willing an&rsquo; glad
if the right woman came along an&rsquo; made you care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he left Lizzie at night school, he returned to the Metropole.</p>
<p>Once in his rooms, he dropped into a Morris chair and sat staring
straight before him.&nbsp; He did not doze.&nbsp; Nor did he think.&nbsp;
His mind was a blank, save for the intervals when unsummoned memory
pictures took form and color and radiance just under his eyelids.&nbsp;
He saw these pictures, but he was scarcely conscious of them&mdash;no
more so than if they had been dreams.&nbsp; Yet he was not asleep.&nbsp;
Once, he roused himself and glanced at his watch.&nbsp; It was just
eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He had nothing to do, and it was too early
for bed.&nbsp; Then his mind went blank again, and the pictures began
to form and vanish under his eyelids.&nbsp; There was nothing distinctive
about the pictures.&nbsp; They were always masses of leaves and shrub-like
branches shot through with hot sunshine.</p>
<p>A knock at the door aroused him.&nbsp; He was not asleep, and his
mind immediately connected the knock with a telegram, or letter, or
perhaps one of the servants bringing back clean clothes from the laundry.&nbsp;
He was thinking about Joe and wondering where he was, as he said, &ldquo;Come
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was still thinking about Joe, and did not turn toward the door.&nbsp;
He heard it close softly.&nbsp; There was a long silence.&nbsp; He forgot
that there had been a knock at the door, and was still staring blankly
before him when he heard a woman&rsquo;s sob.&nbsp; It was involuntary,
spasmodic, checked, and stifled&mdash;he noted that as he turned about.&nbsp;
The next instant he was on his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth!&rdquo; he said, amazed and bewildered.</p>
<p>Her face was white and strained.&nbsp; She stood just inside the
door, one hand against it for support, the other pressed to her side.&nbsp;
She extended both hands toward him piteously, and started forward to
meet him.&nbsp; As he caught her hands and led her to the Morris chair
he noticed how cold they were.&nbsp; He drew up another chair and sat
down on the broad arm of it.&nbsp; He was too confused to speak.&nbsp;
In his own mind his affair with Ruth was closed and sealed.&nbsp; He
felt much in the same way that he would have felt had the Shelly Hot
Springs Laundry suddenly invaded the Hotel Metropole with a whole week&rsquo;s
washing ready for him to pitch into.&nbsp; Several times he was about
to speak, and each time he hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows I am here,&rdquo; Ruth said in a faint voice,
with an appealing smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was surprised at the sound of his own voice.</p>
<p>She repeated her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, then wondered what more he could possibly
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you come in, and I waited a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said again.</p>
<p>He had never been so tongue-tied in his life.&nbsp; Positively he
did not have an idea in his head.&nbsp; He felt stupid and awkward,
but for the life of him he could think of nothing to say.&nbsp; It would
have been easier had the intrusion been the Shelly Hot Springs laundry.&nbsp;
He could have rolled up his sleeves and gone to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you came in,&rdquo; he said finally.</p>
<p>She nodded, with a slightly arch expression, and loosened the scarf
at her throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you first from across the street when you were with
that girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said simply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I took her down
to night school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, aren&rsquo;t you glad to see me?&rdquo; she said at
the end of another silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke hastily.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
wasn&rsquo;t it rash of you to come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I slipped in.&nbsp; Nobody knows I am here.&nbsp; I wanted
to see you.&nbsp; I came to tell you I have been very foolish.&nbsp;
I came because I could no longer stay away, because my heart compelled
me to come, because&mdash;because I wanted to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came forward, out of her chair and over to him.&nbsp; She rested
her hand on his shoulder a moment, breathing quickly, and then slipped
into his arms.&nbsp; And in his large, easy way, desirous of not inflicting
hurt, knowing that to repulse this proffer of herself was to inflict
the most grievous hurt a woman could receive, he folded his arms around
her and held her close.&nbsp; But there was no warmth in the embrace,
no caress in the contact.&nbsp; She had come into his arms, and he held
her, that was all.&nbsp; She nestled against him, and then, with a change
of position, her hands crept up and rested upon his neck.&nbsp; But
his flesh was not fire beneath those hands, and he felt awkward and
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you tremble so?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
it a chill?&nbsp; Shall I light the grate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a movement to disengage himself, but she clung more closely
to him, shivering violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is merely nervousness,&rdquo; she said with chattering
teeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll control myself in a minute.&nbsp; There,
I am better already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly her shivering died away.&nbsp; He continued to hold her, but
he was no longer puzzled.&nbsp; He knew now for what she had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother wanted me to marry Charley Hapgood,&rdquo; she announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charley Hapgood, that fellow who speaks always in platitudes?&rdquo;
Martin groaned.&nbsp; Then he added, &ldquo;And now, I suppose, your
mother wants you to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not put it in the form of a question.&nbsp; He stated it as
a certitude, and before his eyes began to dance the rows of figures
of his royalties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will not object, I know that much,&rdquo; Ruth said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She considers me quite eligible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I am not a bit more eligible now than I was when she
broke our engagement,&rdquo; he meditated.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
changed any.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the same Martin Eden, though for that matter
I&rsquo;m a bit worse&mdash;I smoke now.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you smell
my breath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In reply she pressed her open fingers against his lips, placed them
graciously and playfully, and in expectancy of the kiss that of old
had always been a consequence.&nbsp; But there was no caressing answer
of Martin&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; He waited until the fingers were removed
and then went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not changed.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t got a job.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
not looking for a job.&nbsp; Furthermore, I am not going to look for
a job.&nbsp; And I still believe that Herbert Spencer is a great and
noble man and that Judge Blount is an unmitigated ass.&nbsp; I had dinner
with him the other night, so I ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t accept father&rsquo;s invitation,&rdquo;
she chided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you know about that?&nbsp; Who sent him?&nbsp; Your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she did send him.&nbsp; I thought so.&nbsp; And now I
suppose she has sent you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows that I am here,&rdquo; she protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you think my mother would permit this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d permit you to marry me, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a sharp cry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Martin, don&rsquo;t be cruel.&nbsp;
You have not kissed me once.&nbsp; You are as unresponsive as a stone.&nbsp;
And think what I have dared to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked about her
with a shiver, though half the look was curiosity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just
think of where I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I could die for you!&nbsp; I could die for you</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;Lizzie&rsquo;s
words were ringing in his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you dare it before?&rdquo; he asked harshly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When I hadn&rsquo;t a job?&nbsp; When I was starving?&nbsp; When
I was just as I am now, as a man, as an artist, the same Martin Eden?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the question I&rsquo;ve been propounding to myself for
many a day&mdash;not concerning you merely, but concerning everybody.&nbsp;
You see I have not changed, though my sudden apparent appreciation in
value compels me constantly to reassure myself on that point.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got the same flesh on my bones, the same ten fingers and
toes.&nbsp; I am the same.&nbsp; I have not developed any new strength
nor virtue.&nbsp; My brain is the same old brain.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t
made even one new generalization on literature or philosophy.&nbsp;
I am personally of the same value that I was when nobody wanted me.&nbsp;
And what is puzzling me is why they want me now.&nbsp; Surely they don&rsquo;t
want me for myself, for myself is the same old self they did not want.&nbsp;
Then they must want me for something else, for something that is outside
of me, for something that is not I!&nbsp; Shall I tell you what that
something is?&nbsp; It is for the recognition I have received.&nbsp;
That recognition is not I.&nbsp; It resides in the minds of others.&nbsp;
Then again for the money I have earned and am earning.&nbsp; But that
money is not I.&nbsp; It resides in banks and in the pockets of Tom,
Dick, and Harry.&nbsp; And is it for that, for the recognition and the
money, that you now want me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are breaking my heart,&rdquo; she sobbed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know I love you, that I am here because I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you don&rsquo;t see my point,&rdquo; he said gently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What I mean is: if you love me, how does it happen that you love
me now so much more than you did when your love was weak enough to deny
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget and forgive,&rdquo; she cried passionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
loved you all the time, remember that, and I am here, now, in your arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I am a shrewd merchant, peering into the
scales, trying to weigh your love and find out what manner of thing
it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She withdrew herself from his arms, sat upright, and looked at him
long and searchingly.&nbsp; She was about to speak, then faltered and
changed her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, it appears this way to me,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When I was all that I am now, nobody out of my own class seemed
to care for me.&nbsp; When my books were all written, no one who had
read the manuscripts seemed to care for them.&nbsp; In point of fact,
because of the stuff I had written they seemed to care even less for
me.&nbsp; In writing the stuff it seemed that I had committed acts that
were, to say the least, derogatory.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get a job,&rsquo; everybody
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made a movement of dissent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;except in your case you told
me to get a position.&nbsp; The homely word <i>job</i>, like much that
I have written, offends you.&nbsp; It is brutal.&nbsp; But I assure
you it was no less brutal to me when everybody I knew recommended it
to me as they would recommend right conduct to an immoral creature.&nbsp;
But to return.&nbsp; The publication of what I had written, and the
public notice I received, wrought a change in the fibre of your love.&nbsp;
Martin Eden, with his work all performed, you would not marry.&nbsp;
Your love for him was not strong enough to enable you to marry him.&nbsp;
But your love is now strong enough, and I cannot avoid the conclusion
that its strength arises from the publication and the public notice.&nbsp;
In your case I do not mention royalties, though I am certain that they
apply to the change wrought in your mother and father.&nbsp; Of course,
all this is not flattering to me.&nbsp; But worst of all, it makes me
question love, sacred love.&nbsp; Is love so gross a thing that it must
feed upon publication and public notice?&nbsp; It would seem so.&nbsp;
I have sat and thought upon it till my head went around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, dear head.&rdquo;&nbsp; She reached up a hand and passed
the fingers soothingly through his hair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let it go around
no more.&nbsp; Let us begin anew, now.&nbsp; I loved you all the time.&nbsp;
I know that I was weak in yielding to my mother&rsquo;s will.&nbsp;
I should not have done so.&nbsp; Yet I have heard you speak so often
with broad charity of the fallibility and frailty of humankind.&nbsp;
Extend that charity to me.&nbsp; I acted mistakenly.&nbsp; Forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do forgive,&rdquo; he said impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is easy to forgive where there is really nothing to forgive.&nbsp; Nothing
that you have done requires forgiveness.&nbsp; One acts according to
one&rsquo;s lights, and more than that one cannot do.&nbsp; As well
might I ask you to forgive me for my not getting a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant well,&rdquo; she protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know
that I could not have loved you and not meant well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True; but you would have destroyed me out of your well-meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he shut off her attempted objection.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You would have destroyed my writing and my career.&nbsp; Realism
is imperative to my nature, and the bourgeois spirit hates realism.&nbsp;
The bourgeoisie is cowardly.&nbsp; It is afraid of life.&nbsp; And all
your effort was to make me afraid of life.&nbsp; You would have formalized
me.&nbsp; You would have compressed me into a two-by-four pigeonhole
of life, where all life&rsquo;s values are unreal, and false, and vulgar.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He felt her stir protestingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vulgarity&mdash;a hearty
vulgarity, I&rsquo;ll admit&mdash;is the basis of bourgeois refinement
and culture.&nbsp; As I say, you wanted to formalize me, to make me
over into one of your own class, with your class-ideals, class-values,
and class-prejudices.&rdquo;&nbsp; He shook his head sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
you do not understand, even now, what I am saying.&nbsp; My words do
not mean to you what I endeavor to make them mean.&nbsp; What I say
is so much fantasy to you.&nbsp; Yet to me it is vital reality.&nbsp;
At the best you are a trifle puzzled and amused that this raw boy, crawling
up out of the mire of the abyss, should pass judgment upon your class
and call it vulgar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned her head wearily against his shoulder, and her body shivered
with recurrent nervousness.&nbsp; He waited for a time for her to speak,
and then went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you want to renew our love.&nbsp; You want us to be
married.&nbsp; You want me.&nbsp; And yet, listen&mdash;if my books
had not been noticed, I&rsquo;d nevertheless have been just what I am
now.&nbsp; And you would have stayed away.&nbsp; It is all those damned
books&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t swear,&rdquo; she interrupted.</p>
<p>Her reproof startled him.&nbsp; He broke into a harsh laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at a high moment,
when what seems your life&rsquo;s happiness is at stake, you are afraid
of life in the same old way&mdash;afraid of life and a healthy oath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was stung by his words into realization of the puerility of her
act, and yet she felt that he had magnified it unduly and was consequently
resentful.&nbsp; They sat in silence for a long time, she thinking desperately
and he pondering upon his love which had departed.&nbsp; He knew, now,
that he had not really loved her.&nbsp; It was an idealized Ruth he
had loved, an ethereal creature of his own creating, the bright and
luminous spirit of his love-poems.&nbsp; The real bourgeois Ruth, with
all the bourgeois failings and with the hopeless cramp of the bourgeois
psychology in her mind, he had never loved.</p>
<p>She suddenly began to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that much you have said is so.&nbsp; I have been afraid
of life.&nbsp; I did not love you well enough.&nbsp; I have learned
to love better.&nbsp; I love you for what you are, for what you were,
for the ways even by which you have become.&nbsp; I love you for the
ways wherein you differ from what you call my class, for your beliefs
which I do not understand but which I know I can come to understand.&nbsp;
I shall devote myself to understanding them.&nbsp; And even your smoking
and your swearing&mdash;they are part of you and I will love you for
them, too.&nbsp; I can still learn.&nbsp; In the last ten minutes I
have learned much.&nbsp; That I have dared to come here is a token of
what I have already learned.&nbsp; Oh, Martin!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was sobbing and nestling close against him.</p>
<p>For the first time his arms folded her gently and with sympathy,
and she acknowledged it with a happy movement and a brightening face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too late,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; He remembered Lizzie&rsquo;s
words.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a sick man&mdash;oh, not my body.&nbsp; It
is my soul, my brain.&nbsp; I seem to have lost all values.&nbsp; I
care for nothing.&nbsp; If you had been this way a few months ago, it
would have been different.&nbsp; It is too late, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not too late,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
show you.&nbsp; I will prove to you that my love has grown, that it
is greater to me than my class and all that is dearest to me.&nbsp;
All that is dearest to the bourgeoisie I will flout.&nbsp; I am no longer
afraid of life.&nbsp; I will leave my father and mother, and let my
name become a by-word with my friends.&nbsp; I will come to you here
and now, in free love if you will, and I will be proud and glad to be
with you.&nbsp; If I have been a traitor to love, I will now, for love&rsquo;s
sake, be a traitor to all that made that earlier treason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood before him, with shining eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am waiting, Martin,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;waiting
for you to accept me.&nbsp; Look at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was splendid, he thought, looking at her.&nbsp; She had redeemed
herself for all that she had lacked, rising up at last, true woman,
superior to the iron rule of bourgeois convention.&nbsp; It was splendid,
magnificent, desperate.&nbsp; And yet, what was the matter with him?&nbsp;
He was not thrilled nor stirred by what she had done.&nbsp; It was splendid
and magnificent only intellectually.&nbsp; In what should have been
a moment of fire, he coldly appraised her.&nbsp; His heart was untouched.&nbsp;
He was unaware of any desire for her.&nbsp; Again he remembered Lizzie&rsquo;s
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sick, very sick,&rdquo; he said with a despairing gesture.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How sick I did not know till now.&nbsp; Something has gone out
of me.&nbsp; I have always been unafraid of life, but I never dreamed
of being sated with life.&nbsp; Life has so filled me that I am empty
of any desire for anything.&nbsp; If there were room, I should want
you, now.&nbsp; You see how sick I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned his head back and closed his eyes; and like a child, crying,
that forgets its grief in watching the sunlight percolate through the
tear-dimmed films over the pupils, so Martin forgot his sickness, the
presence of Ruth, everything, in watching the masses of vegetation,
shot through hotly with sunshine that took form and blazed against this
background of his eyelids.&nbsp; It was not restful, that green foliage.&nbsp;
The sunlight was too raw and glaring.&nbsp; It hurt him to look at it,
and yet he looked, he knew not why.</p>
<p>He was brought back to himself by the rattle of the door-knob.&nbsp;
Ruth was at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall I get out?&rdquo; she questioned tearfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, forgive me,&rdquo; he cried, springing to his feet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not myself, you know.&nbsp; I forgot you were here.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He put his hand to his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m not just
right.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take you home.&nbsp; We can go out by the servants&rsquo;
entrance.&nbsp; No one will see us.&nbsp; Pull down that veil and everything
will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clung to his arm through the dim-lighted passages and down the
narrow stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am safe now,&rdquo; she said, when they emerged on the sidewalk,
at the same time starting to take her hand from his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;ll see you home,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she objected.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she started to remove her hand.&nbsp; He felt a momentary curiosity.&nbsp;
Now that she was out of danger she was afraid.&nbsp; She was in almost
a panic to be quit of him.&nbsp; He could see no reason for it and attributed
it to her nervousness.&nbsp; So he restrained her withdrawing hand and
started to walk on with her.&nbsp; Halfway down the block, he saw a
man in a long overcoat shrink back into a doorway.&nbsp; He shot a glance
in as he passed by, and, despite the high turned-up collar, he was certain
that he recognized Ruth&rsquo;s brother, Norman.</p>
<p>During the walk Ruth and Martin held little conversation.&nbsp; She
was stunned.&nbsp; He was apathetic.&nbsp; Once, he mentioned that he
was going away, back to the South Seas, and, once, she asked him to
forgive her having come to him.&nbsp; And that was all.&nbsp; The parting
at her door was conventional.&nbsp; They shook hands, said good night,
and he lifted his hat.&nbsp; The door swung shut, and he lighted a cigarette
and turned back for his hotel.&nbsp; When he came to the doorway into
which he had seen Norman shrink, he stopped and looked in in a speculative
humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She lied,&rdquo; he said aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;She made believe
to me that she had dared greatly, and all the while she knew the brother
that brought her was waiting to take her back.&rdquo;&nbsp; He burst
into laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, these bourgeois!&nbsp; When I was broke,
I was not fit to be seen with his sister.&nbsp; When I have a bank account,
he brings her to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he swung on his heel to go on, a tramp, going in the same direction,
begged him over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, mister, can you give me a quarter to get a bed?&rdquo;
were the words.</p>
<p>But it was the voice that made Martin turn around.&nbsp; The next
instant he had Joe by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye remember that time we parted at the Hot Springs?&rdquo;
the other was saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;I said then we&rsquo;d meet again.&nbsp;
I felt it in my bones.&nbsp; An&rsquo; here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking good,&rdquo; Martin said admiringly,
&ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve put on weight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure have.&rdquo;&nbsp; Joe&rsquo;s face was beaming.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never knew what it was to live till I hit hoboin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m thirty pounds heavier an&rsquo; feel tiptop all the time.&nbsp;
Why, I was worked to skin an&rsquo; bone in them old days.&nbsp; Hoboin&rsquo;
sure agrees with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re looking for a bed just the same,&rdquo; Martin
chided, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a cold night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh?&nbsp; Lookin&rsquo; for a bed?&rdquo;&nbsp; Joe shot
a hand into his hip pocket and brought it out filled with small change.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That beats hard graft,&rdquo; he exulted.&nbsp; &ldquo;You just
looked good; that&rsquo;s why I battered you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin laughed and gave in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve several full-sized drunks right there,&rdquo;
he insinuated.</p>
<p>Joe slid the money back into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in mine,&rdquo; he announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;No gettin&rsquo;
oryide for me, though there ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to stop me except
I don&rsquo;t want to.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve ben drunk once since I seen
you last, an&rsquo; then it was unexpected, bein&rsquo; on an empty
stomach.&nbsp; When I work like a beast, I drink like a beast.&nbsp;
When I live like a man, I drink like a man&mdash;a jolt now an&rsquo;
again when I feel like it, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin arranged to meet him next day, and went on to the hotel.&nbsp;
He paused in the office to look up steamer sailings.&nbsp; The <i>Mariposa</i>
sailed for Tahiti in five days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telephone over to-morrow and reserve a stateroom for me,&rdquo;
he told the clerk.&nbsp; &ldquo;No deck-stateroom, but down below, on
the weather-side,&mdash;the port-side, remember that, the port-side.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d better write it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once in his room he got into bed and slipped off to sleep as gently
as a child.&nbsp; The occurrences of the evening had made no impression
on him.&nbsp; His mind was dead to impressions.&nbsp; The glow of warmth
with which he met Joe had been most fleeting.&nbsp; The succeeding minute
he had been bothered by the ex-laundryman&rsquo;s presence and by the
compulsion of conversation.&nbsp; That in five more days he sailed for
his loved South Seas meant nothing to him.&nbsp; So he closed his eyes
and slept normally and comfortably for eight uninterrupted hours.&nbsp;
He was not restless.&nbsp; He did not change his position, nor did he
dream.&nbsp; Sleep had become to him oblivion, and each day that he
awoke, he awoke with regret.&nbsp; Life worried and bored him, and time
was a vexation.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVI</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Joe,&rdquo; was his greeting to his old-time working-mate
next morning, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a Frenchman out on Twenty-eighth
Street.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s made a pot of money, and he&rsquo;s going back
to France.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a dandy, well-appointed, small steam laundry.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a start for you if you want to settle down.&nbsp; Here,
take this; buy some clothes with it and be at this man&rsquo;s office
by ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He looked up the laundry for me, and he&rsquo;ll
take you out and show you around.&nbsp; If you like it, and think it
is worth the price&mdash;twelve thousand&mdash;let me know and it is
yours.&nbsp; Now run along.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m busy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see
you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, Mart,&rdquo; the other said slowly, with kindling
anger, &ldquo;I come here this mornin&rsquo; to see you.&nbsp; Savve?&nbsp;
I didn&rsquo;t come here to get no laundry.&nbsp; I come a here for
a talk for old friends&rsquo; sake, and you shove a laundry at me.&nbsp;
I tell you, what you can do.&nbsp; You can take that laundry an&rsquo;
go to hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was out of the room when Martin caught him and whirled him around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, Joe,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if you act that
way, I&rsquo;ll punch your head.&nbsp; An for old friends&rsquo; sake
I&rsquo;ll punch it hard.&nbsp; Savve?&mdash;you will, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe had clinched and attempted to throw him, and he was twisting
and writhing out of the advantage of the other&rsquo;s hold.&nbsp; They
reeled about the room, locked in each other&rsquo;s arms, and came down
with a crash across the splintered wreckage of a wicker chair.&nbsp;
Joe was underneath, with arms spread out and held and with Martin&rsquo;s
knee on his chest.&nbsp; He was panting and gasping for breath when
Martin released him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll talk a moment,&rdquo; Martin said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t get fresh with me.&nbsp; I want that laundry business finished
first of all.&nbsp; Then you can come back and we&rsquo;ll talk for
old sake&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; I told you I was busy.&nbsp; Look at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A servant had just come in with the morning mail, a great mass of
letters and magazines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I wade through that and talk with you?&nbsp; You go
and fix up that laundry, and then we&rsquo;ll get together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Joe admitted reluctantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
thought you was turnin&rsquo; me down, but I guess I was mistaken.&nbsp;
But you can&rsquo;t lick me, Mart, in a stand-up fight.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
got the reach on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put on the gloves sometime and see,&rdquo; Martin
said with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure; as soon as I get that laundry going.&rdquo;&nbsp; Joe
extended his arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see that reach?&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll
make you go a few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin heaved a sigh of relief when the door closed behind the laundryman.&nbsp;
He was becoming anti-social.&nbsp; Daily he found it a severer strain
to be decent with people.&nbsp; Their presence perturbed him, and the
effort of conversation irritated him.&nbsp; They made him restless,
and no sooner was he in contact with them than he was casting about
for excuses to get rid of them.</p>
<p>He did not proceed to attack his mail, and for a half hour he lolled
in his chair, doing nothing, while no more than vague, half-formed thoughts
occasionally filtered through his intelligence, or rather, at wide intervals,
themselves constituted the flickering of his intelligence.</p>
<p>He roused himself and began glancing through his mail.&nbsp; There
were a dozen requests for autographs&mdash;he knew them at sight; there
were professional begging letters; and there were letters from cranks,
ranging from the man with a working model of perpetual motion, and the
man who demonstrated that the surface of the earth was the inside of
a hollow sphere, to the man seeking financial aid to purchase the Peninsula
of Lower California for the purpose of communist colonization.&nbsp;
There were letters from women seeking to know him, and over one such
he smiled, for enclosed was her receipt for pew-rent, sent as evidence
of her good faith and as proof of her respectability.</p>
<p>Editors and publishers contributed to the daily heap of letters,
the former on their knees for his manuscripts, the latter on their knees
for his books&mdash;his poor disdained manuscripts that had kept all
he possessed in pawn for so many dreary months in order to fund them
in postage.&nbsp; There were unexpected checks for English serial rights
and for advance payments on foreign translations.&nbsp; His English
agent announced the sale of German translation rights in three of his
books, and informed him that Swedish editions, from which he could expect
nothing because Sweden was not a party to the Berne Convention, were
already on the market.&nbsp; Then there was a nominal request for his
permission for a Russian translation, that country being likewise outside
the Berne Convention.</p>
<p>He turned to the huge bundle of clippings which had come in from
his press bureau, and read about himself and his vogue, which had become
a furore.&nbsp; All his creative output had been flung to the public
in one magnificent sweep.&nbsp; That seemed to account for it.&nbsp;
He had taken the public off its feet, the way Kipling had, that time
when he lay near to death and all the mob, animated by a mob-mind thought,
began suddenly to read him.&nbsp; Martin remembered how that same world-mob,
having read him and acclaimed him and not understood him in the least,
had, abruptly, a few months later, flung itself upon him and torn him
to pieces.&nbsp; Martin grinned at the thought.&nbsp; Who was he that
he should not be similarly treated in a few more months?&nbsp; Well,
he would fool the mob.&nbsp; He would be away, in the South Seas, building
his grass house, trading for pearls and copra, jumping reefs in frail
outriggers, catching sharks and bonitas, hunting wild goats among the
cliffs of the valley that lay next to the valley of Taiohae.</p>
<p>In the moment of that thought the desperateness of his situation
dawned upon him.&nbsp; He saw, cleared eyed, that he was in the Valley
of the Shadow.&nbsp; All the life that was in him was fading, fainting,
making toward death.</p>
<p>He realized how much he slept, and how much he desired to sleep.&nbsp;
Of old, he had hated sleep.&nbsp; It had robbed him of precious moments
of living.&nbsp; Four hours of sleep in the twenty-four had meant being
robbed of four hours of life.&nbsp; How he had grudged sleep!&nbsp;
Now it was life he grudged.&nbsp; Life was not good; its taste in his
mouth was without tang, and bitter.&nbsp; This was his peril.&nbsp;
Life that did not yearn toward life was in fair way toward ceasing.&nbsp;
Some remote instinct for preservation stirred in him, and he knew he
must get away.&nbsp; He glanced about the room, and the thought of packing
was burdensome.&nbsp; Perhaps it would be better to leave that to the
last.&nbsp; In the meantime he might be getting an outfit.</p>
<p>He put on his hat and went out, stopping in at a gun-store, where
he spent the remainder of the morning buying automatic rifles, ammunition,
and fishing tackle.&nbsp; Fashions changed in trading, and he knew he
would have to wait till he reached Tahiti before ordering his trade-goods.&nbsp;
They could come up from Australia, anyway.&nbsp; This solution was a
source of pleasure.&nbsp; He had avoided doing something, and the doing
of anything just now was unpleasant.&nbsp; He went back to the hotel
gladly, with a feeling of satisfaction in that the comfortable Morris
chair was waiting for him; and he groaned inwardly, on entering his
room, at sight of Joe in the Morris chair.</p>
<p>Joe was delighted with the laundry.&nbsp; Everything was settled,
and he would enter into possession next day.&nbsp; Martin lay on the
bed, with closed eyes, while the other talked on.&nbsp; Martin&rsquo;s
thoughts were far away&mdash;so far away that he was rarely aware that
he was thinking.&nbsp; It was only by an effort that he occasionally
responded.&nbsp; And yet this was Joe, whom he had always liked.&nbsp;
But Joe was too keen with life.&nbsp; The boisterous impact of it on
Martin&rsquo;s jaded mind was a hurt.&nbsp; It was an aching probe to
his tired sensitiveness.&nbsp; When Joe reminded him that sometime in
the future they were going to put on the gloves together, he could almost
have screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, Joe, you&rsquo;re to run the laundry according to
those old rules you used to lay down at Shelly Hot Springs,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;No overworking.&nbsp; No working at night.&nbsp;
And no children at the mangles.&nbsp; No children anywhere.&nbsp; And
a fair wage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe nodded and pulled out a note-book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at here.&nbsp; I was workin&rsquo; out them rules before
breakfast this A.M.&nbsp; What d&rsquo;ye think of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He read them aloud, and Martin approved, worrying at the same time
as to when Joe would take himself off.</p>
<p>It was late afternoon when he awoke.&nbsp; Slowly the fact of life
came back to him.&nbsp; He glanced about the room.&nbsp; Joe had evidently
stolen away after he had dozed off.&nbsp; That was considerate of Joe,
he thought.&nbsp; Then he closed his eyes and slept again.</p>
<p>In the days that followed Joe was too busy organizing and taking
hold of the laundry to bother him much; and it was not until the day
before sailing that the newspapers made the announcement that he had
taken passage on the <i>Mariposa</i>.&nbsp; Once, when the instinct
of preservation fluttered, he went to a doctor and underwent a searching
physical examination.&nbsp; Nothing could be found the matter with him.&nbsp;
His heart and lungs were pronounced magnificent.&nbsp; Every organ,
so far as the doctor could know, was normal and was working normally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing the matter with you, Mr. Eden,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;positively nothing the matter with you.&nbsp; You are in
the pink of condition.&nbsp; Candidly, I envy you your health.&nbsp;
It is superb.&nbsp; Look at that chest.&nbsp; There, and in your stomach,
lies the secret of your remarkable constitution.&nbsp; Physically, you
are a man in a thousand&mdash;in ten thousand.&nbsp; Barring accidents,
you should live to be a hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Martin knew that Lizzie&rsquo;s diagnosis had been correct.&nbsp;
Physically he was all right.&nbsp; It was his &ldquo;think-machine&rdquo;
that had gone wrong, and there was no cure for that except to get away
to the South Seas.&nbsp; The trouble was that now, on the verge of departure,
he had no desire to go.&nbsp; The South Seas charmed him no more than
did bourgeois civilization.&nbsp; There was no zest in the thought of
departure, while the act of departure appalled him as a weariness of
the flesh.&nbsp; He would have felt better if he were already on board
and gone.</p>
<p>The last day was a sore trial.&nbsp; Having read of his sailing in
the morning papers, Bernard Higginbotham, Gertrude, and all the family
came to say good-by, as did Hermann von Schmidt and Marian.&nbsp; Then
there was business to be transacted, bills to be paid, and everlasting
reporters to be endured.&nbsp; He said good-by to Lizzie Connolly, abruptly,
at the entrance to night school, and hurried away.&nbsp; At the hotel
he found Joe, too busy all day with the laundry to have come to him
earlier.&nbsp; It was the last straw, but Martin gripped the arms of
his chair and talked and listened for half an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Joe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you are not tied
down to that laundry.&nbsp; There are no strings on it.&nbsp; You can
sell it any time and blow the money.&nbsp; Any time you get sick of
it and want to hit the road, just pull out.&nbsp; Do what will make
you the happiest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more road in mine, thank you kindly.&nbsp; Hoboin&rsquo;s
all right, exceptin&rsquo; for one thing&mdash;the girls.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
help it, but I&rsquo;m a ladies&rsquo; man.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t get
along without &rsquo;em, and you&rsquo;ve got to get along without &rsquo;em
when you&rsquo;re hoboin&rsquo;.&nbsp; The times I&rsquo;ve passed by
houses where dances an&rsquo; parties was goin&rsquo; on, an&rsquo;
heard the women laugh, an&rsquo; saw their white dresses and smiling
faces through the windows&mdash;Gee!&nbsp; I tell you them moments was
plain hell.&nbsp; I like dancin&rsquo; an&rsquo; picnics, an&rsquo;
walking in the moonlight, an&rsquo; all the rest too well.&nbsp; Me
for the laundry, and a good front, with big iron dollars clinkin&rsquo;
in my jeans.&nbsp; I seen a girl already, just yesterday, and, d&rsquo;ye
know, I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo; already I&rsquo;d just as soon marry her
as not.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve ben whistlin&rsquo; all day at the thought
of it.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a beaut, with the kindest eyes and softest
voice you ever heard.&nbsp; Me for her, you can stack on that.&nbsp;
Say, why don&rsquo;t you get married with all this money to burn?&nbsp;
You could get the finest girl in the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin shook his head with a smile, but in his secret heart he was
wondering why any man wanted to marry.&nbsp; It seemed an amazing and
incomprehensible thing.</p>
<p>From the deck of the <i>Mariposa</i>, at the sailing hour, he saw
Lizzie Connolly hiding in the skirts of the crowd on the wharf.&nbsp;
Take her with you, came the thought.&nbsp; It is easy to be kind.&nbsp;
She will be supremely happy.&nbsp; It was almost a temptation one moment,
and the succeeding moment it became a terror.&nbsp; He was in a panic
at the thought of it.&nbsp; His tired soul cried out in protest.&nbsp;
He turned away from the rail with a groan, muttering, &ldquo;Man, you
are too sick, you are too sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fled to his stateroom, where he lurked until the steamer was clear
of the dock.&nbsp; In the dining saloon, at luncheon, he found himself
in the place of honor, at the captain&rsquo;s right; and he was not
long in discovering that he was the great man on board.&nbsp; But no
more unsatisfactory great man ever sailed on a ship.&nbsp; He spent
the afternoon in a deck-chair, with closed eyes, dozing brokenly most
of the time, and in the evening went early to bed.</p>
<p>After the second day, recovered from seasickness, the full passenger
list was in evidence, and the more he saw of the passengers the more
he disliked them.&nbsp; Yet he knew that he did them injustice.&nbsp;
They were good and kindly people, he forced himself to acknowledge,
and in the moment of acknowledgment he qualified&mdash;good and kindly
like all the bourgeoisie, with all the psychological cramp and intellectual
futility of their kind, they bored him when they talked with him, their
little superficial minds were so filled with emptiness; while the boisterous
high spirits and the excessive energy of the younger people shocked
him.&nbsp; They were never quiet, ceaselessly playing deck-quoits, tossing
rings, promenading, or rushing to the rail with loud cries to watch
the leaping porpoises and the first schools of flying fish.</p>
<p>He slept much.&nbsp; After breakfast he sought his deck-chair with
a magazine he never finished.&nbsp; The printed pages tired him.&nbsp;
He puzzled that men found so much to write about, and, puzzling, dozed
in his chair.&nbsp; When the gong awoke him for luncheon, he was irritated
that he must awaken.&nbsp; There was no satisfaction in being awake.</p>
<p>Once, he tried to arouse himself from his lethargy, and went forward
into the forecastle with the sailors.&nbsp; But the breed of sailors
seemed to have changed since the days he had lived in the forecastle.&nbsp;
He could find no kinship with these stolid-faced, ox-minded bestial
creatures.&nbsp; He was in despair.&nbsp; Up above nobody had wanted
Martin Eden for his own sake, and he could not go back to those of his
own class who had wanted him in the past.&nbsp; He did not want them.&nbsp;
He could not stand them any more than he could stand the stupid first-cabin
passengers and the riotous young people.</p>
<p>Life was to him like strong, white light that hurts the tired eyes
of a sick person.&nbsp; During every conscious moment life blazed in
a raw glare around him and upon him.&nbsp; It hurt.&nbsp; It hurt intolerably.&nbsp;
It was the first time in his life that Martin had travelled first class.&nbsp;
On ships at sea he had always been in the forecastle, the steerage,
or in the black depths of the coal-hold, passing coal.&nbsp; In those
days, climbing up the iron ladders out the pit of stifling heat, he
had often caught glimpses of the passengers, in cool white, doing nothing
but enjoy themselves, under awnings spread to keep the sun and wind
away from them, with subservient stewards taking care of their every
want and whim, and it had seemed to him that the realm in which they
moved and had their being was nothing else than paradise.&nbsp; Well,
here he was, the great man on board, in the midmost centre of it, sitting
at the captain&rsquo;s right hand, and yet vainly harking back to forecastle
and stoke-hole in quest of the Paradise he had lost.&nbsp; He had found
no new one, and now he could not find the old one.</p>
<p>He strove to stir himself and find something to interest him.&nbsp;
He ventured the petty officers&rsquo; mess, and was glad to get away.&nbsp;
He talked with a quartermaster off duty, an intelligent man who promptly
prodded him with the socialist propaganda and forced into his hands
a bunch of leaflets and pamphlets.&nbsp; He listened to the man expounding
the slave-morality, and as he listened, he thought languidly of his
own Nietzsche philosophy.&nbsp; But what was it worth, after all?&nbsp;
He remembered one of Nietzsche&rsquo;s mad utterances wherein that madman
had doubted truth.&nbsp; And who was to say?&nbsp; Perhaps Nietzsche
had been right.&nbsp; Perhaps there was no truth in anything, no truth
in truth&mdash;no such thing as truth.&nbsp; But his mind wearied quickly,
and he was content to go back to his chair and doze.</p>
<p>Miserable as he was on the steamer, a new misery came upon him.&nbsp;
What when the steamer reached Tahiti?&nbsp; He would have to go ashore.&nbsp;
He would have to order his trade-goods, to find a passage on a schooner
to the Marquesas, to do a thousand and one things that were awful to
contemplate.&nbsp; Whenever he steeled himself deliberately to think,
he could see the desperate peril in which he stood.&nbsp; In all truth,
he was in the Valley of the Shadow, and his danger lay in that he was
not afraid.&nbsp; If he were only afraid, he would make toward life.&nbsp;
Being unafraid, he was drifting deeper into the shadow.&nbsp; He found
no delight in the old familiar things of life.&nbsp; The <i>Mariposa</i>
was now in the northeast trades, and this wine of wind, surging against
him, irritated him.&nbsp; He had his chair moved to escape the embrace
of this lusty comrade of old days and nights.</p>
<p>The day the <i>Mariposa</i> entered the doldrums, Martin was more
miserable than ever.&nbsp; He could no longer sleep.&nbsp; He was soaked
with sleep, and perforce he must now stay awake and endure the white
glare of life.&nbsp; He moved about restlessly.&nbsp; The air was sticky
and humid, and the rain-squalls were unrefreshing.&nbsp; He ached with
life.&nbsp; He walked around the deck until that hurt too much, then
sat in his chair until he was compelled to walk again.&nbsp; He forced
himself at last to finish the magazine, and from the steamer library
he culled several volumes of poetry.&nbsp; But they could not hold him,
and once more he took to walking.</p>
<p>He stayed late on deck, after dinner, but that did not help him,
for when he went below, he could not sleep.&nbsp; This surcease from
life had failed him.&nbsp; It was too much.&nbsp; He turned on the electric
light and tried to read.&nbsp; One of the volumes was a Swinburne.&nbsp;
He lay in bed, glancing through its pages, until suddenly he became
aware that he was reading with interest.&nbsp; He finished the stanza,
attempted to read on, then came back to it.&nbsp; He rested the book
face downward on his breast and fell to thinking.&nbsp; That was it.&nbsp;
The very thing.&nbsp; Strange that it had never come to him before.&nbsp;
That was the meaning of it all; he had been drifting that way all the
time, and now Swinburne showed him that it was the happy way out.&nbsp;
He wanted rest, and here was rest awaiting him.&nbsp; He glanced at
the open port-hole.&nbsp; Yes, it was large enough.&nbsp; For the first
time in weeks he felt happy.&nbsp; At last he had discovered the cure
of his ill.&nbsp; He picked up the book and read the stanza slowly aloud:-</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;From too much love of living,<br />
From hope and fear set free,<br />
We thank with brief thanksgiving<br />
Whatever gods may be<br />
That no life lives forever;<br />
That dead men rise up never;<br />
That even the weariest river<br />
Winds somewhere safe to sea.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He looked again at the open port.&nbsp; Swinburne had furnished the
key.&nbsp; Life was ill, or, rather, it had become ill&mdash;an unbearable
thing.&nbsp; &ldquo;That dead men rise up never!&rdquo;&nbsp; That line
stirred him with a profound feeling of gratitude.&nbsp; It was the one
beneficent thing in the universe.&nbsp; When life became an aching weariness,
death was ready to soothe away to everlasting sleep.&nbsp; But what
was he waiting for?&nbsp; It was time to go.</p>
<p>He arose and thrust his head out the port-hole, looking down into
the milky wash.&nbsp; The <i>Mariposa</i> was deeply loaded, and, hanging
by his hands, his feet would be in the water.&nbsp; He could slip in
noiselessly.&nbsp; No one would hear.&nbsp; A smother of spray dashed
up, wetting his face.&nbsp; It tasted salt on his lips, and the taste
was good.&nbsp; He wondered if he ought to write a swan-song, but laughed
the thought away.&nbsp; There was no time.&nbsp; He was too impatient
to be gone.</p>
<p>Turning off the light in his room so that it might not betray him,
he went out the port-hole feet first.&nbsp; His shoulders stuck, and
he forced himself back so as to try it with one arm down by his side.&nbsp;
A roll of the steamer aided him, and he was through, hanging by his
hands.&nbsp; When his feet touched the sea, he let go.&nbsp; He was
in a milky froth of water.&nbsp; The side of the <i>Mariposa</i> rushed
past him like a dark wall, broken here and there by lighted ports.&nbsp;
She was certainly making time.&nbsp; Almost before he knew it, he was
astern, swimming gently on the foam-crackling surface.</p>
<p>A bonita struck at his white body, and he laughed aloud.&nbsp; It
had taken a piece out, and the sting of it reminded him of why he was
there.&nbsp; In the work to do he had forgotten the purpose of it.&nbsp;
The lights of the <i>Mariposa</i> were growing dim in the distance,
and there he was, swimming confidently, as though it were his intention
to make for the nearest land a thousand miles or so away.</p>
<p>It was the automatic instinct to live.&nbsp; He ceased swimming,
but the moment he felt the water rising above his mouth the hands struck
out sharply with a lifting movement.&nbsp; The will to live, was his
thought, and the thought was accompanied by a sneer.&nbsp; Well, he
had will,&mdash;ay, will strong enough that with one last exertion it
could destroy itself and cease to be.</p>
<p>He changed his position to a vertical one.&nbsp; He glanced up at
the quiet stars, at the same time emptying his lungs of air.&nbsp; With
swift, vigorous propulsion of hands and feet, he lifted his shoulders
and half his chest out of water.&nbsp; This was to gain impetus for
the descent.&nbsp; Then he let himself go and sank without movement,
a white statue, into the sea.&nbsp; He breathed in the water deeply,
deliberately, after the manner of a man taking an anaesthetic.&nbsp;
When he strangled, quite involuntarily his arms and legs clawed the
water and drove him up to the surface and into the clear sight of the
stars.</p>
<p>The will to live, he thought disdainfully, vainly endeavoring not
to breathe the air into his bursting lungs.&nbsp; Well, he would have
to try a new way.&nbsp; He filled his lungs with air, filled them full.&nbsp;
This supply would take him far down.&nbsp; He turned over and went down
head first, swimming with all his strength and all his will.&nbsp; Deeper
and deeper he went.&nbsp; His eyes were open, and he watched the ghostly,
phosphorescent trails of the darting bonita.&nbsp; As he swam, he hoped
that they would not strike at him, for it might snap the tension of
his will.&nbsp; But they did not strike, and he found time to be grateful
for this last kindness of life.</p>
<p>Down, down, he swam till his arms and leg grew tired and hardly moved.&nbsp;
He knew that he was deep.&nbsp; The pressure on his ear-drums was a
pain, and there was a buzzing in his head.&nbsp; His endurance was faltering,
but he compelled his arms and legs to drive him deeper until his will
snapped and the air drove from his lungs in a great explosive rush.&nbsp;
The bubbles rubbed and bounded like tiny balloons against his cheeks
and eyes as they took their upward flight.&nbsp; Then came pain and
strangulation.&nbsp; This hurt was not death, was the thought that oscillated
through his reeling consciousness.&nbsp; Death did not hurt.&nbsp; It
was life, the pangs of life, this awful, suffocating feeling; it was
the last blow life could deal him.</p>
<p>His wilful hands and feet began to beat and churn about, spasmodically
and feebly.&nbsp; But he had fooled them and the will to live that made
them beat and churn.&nbsp; He was too deep down.&nbsp; They could never
bring him to the surface.&nbsp; He seemed floating languidly in a sea
of dreamy vision.&nbsp; Colors and radiances surrounded him and bathed
him and pervaded him.&nbsp; What was that?&nbsp; It seemed a lighthouse;
but it was inside his brain&mdash;a flashing, bright white light.&nbsp;
It flashed swifter and swifter.&nbsp; There was a long rumble of sound,
and it seemed to him that he was falling down a vast and interminable
stairway.&nbsp; And somewhere at the bottom he fell into darkness.&nbsp;
That much he knew.&nbsp; He had fallen into darkness.&nbsp; And at the
instant he knew, he ceased to know.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
